Labour has treated its Jewish MPs disgracefully and has allowed hostility towards Jews to fester.  And now a Labour councillor in Hastings has rightfully quit the party because of its failure to tackle vile antisemitism.  https://t.co/bUNdeMdJuJ
Thanks for the question, @GregHands! Automatic enrolment is a huge Government success story. https://t.co/oRjrUXWM9w
Our changes to Universal Credit mean more people get more support, helping them into work and off benefits.  We made these - extending advances, cutting waiting times - because there were issues with the initial roll-out of UC. I‘ve been clear about this since I took over at DWP.
Delighted to confirm to the House that 10 million workers have been automatically enrolled into a workplace pension.  Workplace pensions were seen as the preserve of older, wealthier people.   Now saving is the norm across the UK, wherever you work. https://t.co/mKymDCw6pQ
🗣 Today I will tell Parliament about my plans to introduce jail sentences for bosses who wilfully or recklessly risk your retirement  💪 We are on the side of the saver and I hope all parties back the plan  https://t.co/XqfW9jxNnl

Hi Alex,  Glad you met Charlie.  Your scepticism and conspiracy theories are misplaced.  More than 1.6 million people claim UC, and they have a wide range of life experiences.

Yes, constructive, practical, pro-business.  Well done @NickyMorgan01 https://t.co/Uv6yy1fMB0

Outstanding debut by fantastic @sajidjavid in House of Commons today.
4/4 As Home Secretary I will work to ensure that our immigration policy is fair and humane.
3/4 I didn't see the leaked document, although it was copied to my office as many documents are.
2/4 I wasn't aware of specific removal targets. I accept I should have been and I'm sorry that I wasn't.
1/4 I will be making a statement in the House of Commons on Monday in response to legitimate questions that have arisen on targets and illegal migration.
Thanks to the Press Gallery for hosting me at a challenging yet enjoyable lunch. I should have been clearer - of course when we leave the EU we will be leaving the customs union. I wasn't going to get into ongoing cabinet discussions about our future trading relationship.
I have written for @Pridemag on the great debt we owe the #WindrushGeneration and the action I'm taking to ensure they get the legal status they deserve - British citizenship, quickly, at no cost and with proactive assistance https://t.co/VNZsGdg1nI
@DavidLammy I agree that the Windrush generation are and should be considered British, but changes in law over many years mean some do not have that legal status. Since 1971 no Government has rectified that. This Government will and we are putting in place an easy and free process to do so.
@DavidLammy I agree that the Windrush generation should be considered British, but changes in law over many years mean some do not have that legal status. Since 1971 no Government has rectified that. This Government will and we are putting in place an easy and free process to do so.
As Minister for Women and Equalities I am proud that a statue of the great suffragist Millicent Fawcett - who campaigned for the equal rights of women and men - has been unveiled at the heart of our democracy in Parliament Square #MillicentFawcett #couragecalls #vote100 https://t.co/5R7QKQ4HBz
Today I set out the how we will offer the #WindrushGeneration greater rights than they currently enjoy by enabling them to acquire British citizenship quickly, at no cost and with assistance through the process, and how we will compensate people for the hardship they've endured. https://t.co/XwQijrCFqO

The choice is between @nigel_farage’s little England or a Great Britain with a strong future #StrongerIn #ITVEURef
Choice clear, Farage's Leave Team or coalition of PM, Labour, Lib Dems, Greens, businesses large &amp; small and &amp; major trade unions #ITVEURef
We reduce our influence by walking away. We would have no say on the major global issues #ITVEURef #StrongerIn
Our special status means you have to put in for 4 years before you can take out of the system, no more something for nothing #ITVEURef
PM points out the UK's special status in Europe, outside the Euro, inside the single market #ITVEURef #StrongerIn
Nigel Farage has no plan for Britain’s future, for the economy, for prices, for jobs and for wages #ITVEURef #StrongerIn
Leaving Europe would crash the economy and that would mean fewer homes #ITVEURef #StrongerIn
PMs of commonwealth countries such as Australia, New Zealand and India all support the UK remaining in the EU #ITVEURef #StrongerIn

@pv_techjohn @Energydesk The PM has committed.
@hannon_matthew @Energydesk Yes, we are working to develop carbon capture storage which could provide critical decarbonisation in the future
@TheMushyPea @Energydesk I also want to see businesses to make commitments on climate change + drive behaviours + boost innovation...
@Energydesk ...+ has reiterated support for UK Climate Act. He is respected internationally as a leader on climate change issues.
@Energydesk David Cameron has personally committed to pushing for a global deal to limit warming to two degrees...
@Energydesk ...we differ from Labour by having a strong record of delivery on renewable energy.
@Energydesk We've delivered energy efficiency measures to over 1M homes, 0.5M homes have solar PV on roofs.
@DickWinchester @hannon_matthew @Energydesk Not the case, e.g. we have more offshore wind than the rest of the world put together.
@Energydesk We've been the #greenestgovernmentever - setting up world 1st Green Investment Bank + trebling renewables generation to 19%.
@hannon_matthew @Energydesk DECC supports innovation through investment and guidance. V exciting possibilities re tidal energy.
@1annawatson @Energydesk 99% of solar has happened under this Government, we are committed to helping schools &amp; public buildings acc solar.
@Energydesk ...the goal must be warmer homes for less!
@Energydesk Our Manifesto sets out our long-term plan to keep the lights on, keep homes warm, keep families from worrying about energy bills
@Energydesk Remember too, in 1989 at the UN Margaret Thatcher was the first world leader to sound the alarm on the threat of global warming
@Energydesk Because of the devastating impact it could have nationally and internationally, unless we take action and do what we can.
@Energydesk Looking forward to starting, ask away!

@LocalityJess impacting politicians through policy lobbying is good! That's clear and in bill. The Pier is not &amp; never was party political.
@LocalityJess You didn't campaign for a party but for a policy. The pier wasn't a political issue but a community one.  Don't change that.
@JerichoJess absolutely not true Jess.  It's about transparency not prohibition.  Lets not mislead people.
@AlexLeRoux1 @Hugodixon good point!
@andrewrawnsley but he was in the House of Commons, where his speech went down well and was well reported in the press.
