All political parties have come together on this - along with the superb dedication of staff from the Commons, the Lords and Cabinet Office. Thank you for turning our ambition into reality.
Changing the culture in Westminster will take time. If we want to be one of the best parliaments to work in in the world, we must never stop asking ourselves: ‚Äòwhat more can we do?‚Äô
This is not the end of the process, it‚Äôs just the start. We‚Äôll review and tweak after 6 and 18 months to ensure the processes are working.
And to tackle MPs marking their own homework, voting on the Standards Committee is now transparent, giving lay members a fair say.
A new range of sanctions will mean low-level wrongdoing, right through to the worst cases, will receive a fitting and appropriate punishment.
The new complaints process offers confidentiality and independence to all involved.
Whether you are a staff member, peer, MP, journalist, contractor or visitor - the new behaviour code will set a clear expectation of how we behave and treat each other.
A thread on Parliament‚Äôs unanimous decision to fundamentally change the way it deals with complaints of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment. #MeToo @HouseofCommons @UKHouseofLords @UKParliament
