When did Parl become the place when to score a political point, elected members would traduce and destroy the lifetime reputation and integrity of a wholly honest, and decent man? A fellow MP -  @Keir_Starmer should be careful what he wishes for I once held him in the same regard
The attorney has repeated over and over, the decision wether or not to vote for this deal is a political one, not legal. I have sympathy with his desire to protect the public interest. Provision for redaction should be available to resolve this.
The problem with the legal provisions as being articulated now in the chamber by the Attorneys General - is that we are dependent upon the EU playing fair and abiding by the spirit of the political declaration. Even supporters of the deal baulk at that
No10 are panicking and resorting to telling MPs untruthful information in order to push them to vote. Right now in No10, this deceit is taking place. https://t.co/cyj8puJDyJ
We now know as a result of the legal advice, that those being told it can all be changed later, we just need to get the deal over the line, are being lied to.  We cannot change anything without breaking the law and we Brits don‚Äôt do that. We play by the rules.

In the event of a confidence vote, MPs would in effect be voting to keep the PM in place for 12 more months.   If during that time, the gov fell and given the deal and position of the DUP, not unlikely, we would be taken into a GE with Theresa May as leader by default.
If Graham Brady received 158 letters it would remove the need for a vote of no confidence.   There is also no requirement for letters to be published or to be made public.

To be clear, I submitted my own letter to Graham Brady some weeks ago. The writing has been on the wall for some time.
PM using weasel words. When she states, it‚Äôs our choice wether or not we want to leave, she fails to finish the answer with - and then it‚Äôs their choice to decide wether or not they let us go. It‚Äôs the worst kind of spin. A disgraceful and patronising slight to MPs and country.

@a_leesha1 @finnyofthenorth I firmly believe that in the progressive and liberal society that is the U.K. face covering should be illegal, totally body covering exposed for what it is, medieval misogyny.
@a_leesha1 @finnyofthenorth They aren‚Äôt though, are they. They are segregated and suppressed. It‚Äôs a medieval costume with no place in today‚Äôs liberal society. No progressive country should tolerate it.
Some MPs oppose the banning of the burka, but want to banish grid girls from existence. You cannot expect a society that celebrates gay pride and embraces gay marriage to live harmoniously when condoning the suppression of women forced to cover up, segregate and become invisible

The gold plated pension funds, BBC presenters etc live off shore and wouldn‚Äôt be affected. Only British public sector workers and small to medium private pension holders would suffer under a Corbyn government that the 12 Conservative rebels risked.
The media should be very aware that Soubry and Co voted last night to take the country to a general election and risk an anti semetic, communist Corbyn government that would wipe out non gold plated pension funds (teachers, doctors etc) and believe property is theft #madness

I think you have been deceived.

Well done to @bernardjenkin on @BBCr4today People didn‚Äôt vote with their hearts, not understanding the outcome- they voted to leave.

From @Jacob_Rees_Mogg   There are very few signs of the Prime Minister‚Äôs famous red lines. In particular this paper sets out that the UK will be subject to EU laws while having no say in their creation. Taken as a whole this recreates many of the worst aspects of the EU.
Also said, 70% of our core vote is leave, many UKIP ers who denied us government and councils for long have come back into Conservative fold - should we proceed with Chequers deal, ‚Äò97 will happen all over again. Trouble is, many Tory MPs too young to remember what that felt like
Said this would happen to every MP I spoke to-some replied, ‚Äòbut, we‚Äôve only dropped 2 points, not that big a deal.‚Äô I predicted a 5-7 pt drop  by the w/e, they laughed. A 7pt drop would wipe out half the party in an election. I really hope I‚Äôm wrong and they are right #Egosrule https://t.co/Lvks9aOBWE

@piglet2602 Actually, I did. NHS pay for nurses under Labour in the 70s was so bad, we almost bloody starved. I paid to live in the nurses home bcse we got cheap board and free milky coffee which is almost all I lived on
@DidiOfTheMail Oh Lord, that was a joke !!!
As a former nurse, I would like to say, #HappyBirthdayNHS and thank you for all that you taught me-  but especially, that a patient in pain, a Queen or a pauper, deserves the same level of compassion and care. At the time, I was a pauper and was so proud to be a nurse in the #NHS
@_casey__jones_ No!
2/2 embarrassed and was so anxious that W would be hurt. I had been thinking about it for months and the reasons I voted, mainly techy are still valid, but I should never have voted against a commitment to love.
I decided to say this last week, when attending a meeting in London. My loyal, long serving/suffering, gay researcher, W who was working late accompanied me. I was introduced on the platform as having voted against and half the room erupted with applause. I felt sick and 1/2 https://t.co/t3jI4httbm

Depending on @theresa_may to be true to her word in her speeches and to Parl. If the cabinet agree to renege on those promises, if an elitist, behind closed doors in smoke filled rooms deal is cobbled together -the British people will punish  us all. Democracy will be in peril

#Brexit cannot mean continued membership of the CU even in a time limited capacity bcse that is not #Brexit. ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs just get over the line‚Äô is a specious argument bcse it would take a generation to de-couple and untangle. The next 7 days are going to be interesting.

One thing is clear though, if Labour ever came into power, Leveson 2 would be rapidly implemented.
I have huge sympathy and respect for @tom_watson and his tireless campaigning and his points re Leveson. As someone who has been ‚Äòdone over‚Äô by the media, I hear his plea. However, press freedom is a pillar of a free and fair society and our job, is to uphold that principle.

Majority of Labour MPs treading fine line publicly, reticently, supporting Corbyn, + hoping Labours poll ratings plummet to kick start a reaction that may in itself act as a catalyst and bring about an opportunity to seize back control. In doing so they deceive the electorate
Having stood in the same lobbies as Corbyn for over 13 years, this statement could not be more wrong. Corbyn has always operated in a satellite group opposed to fundamental principles of Labour. https://t.co/haznFVoiKI
If you are a woman and you support @UKLabour you have to ask yourself, why? It is a party that will never elect a woman leader or select a woman to stand as @MayorofLondon and it‚Äôs racism is proven beyond doubt. Why?
@socialist1959 What she says about ant semitism in the Labour Party is bang on and therefore  makes Corbyn unfit to lead

Has a female MP ever been on Merton‚Äôs team? It would be interesting to know how many women have been paired with him compared to being paired with Ian?
Also acknowledge that Ian coming into make up (also to welcome me to the show) to warn me not to even try and speak to Merton may have been a set up tactic to terrify me even further before the show, however, Merton‚Äôs attitude in the after show geeen room made me doubt that
Having said all that - I also would have loved to host, but I‚Äôm not sure I was ever offered that. I was so put off by Merton‚Äôs manner and hostility, I just never wanted to go back !!
Which is off putting in the extreme when you are in what is essentially a vulnerable situation. It was his gig and his manner and body language was intimidating. Maybe this is what men do to each other when they want to assert their authority and mark their territory?
It‚Äôs v different for female MPs- we are the target. Ian Hislop was lovely. Kindly, welcoming and tried to put me at my ease. Came into make up to say hello and warned me not to try and speak to Merton. He was right - Merton was hostile, unwelcoming and lacked basic good manners https://t.co/85DyuczYbH

I‚Äôve been a rebel myself, but never when a Marxist government was knocking at the door.
Tonight, the Tory rebels have put a spring in Labours step, given them a taste of winning, guaranteed the party a weekend of bad press, undermined the PM and devalued her impact in Brussels. They should be deselected and never allowed to stand as a Tory MP, ever again.

@01Kirsty Lol! There‚Äôs a lot of very silly people about!!
Flattered by number of people on here who think I‚Äôm part of the Government and have access to government docs üòÖ I‚Äôm a back bench MP - 2 Westminster based computers in a shared office. On my computer, there is a shared email account. That‚Äôs it. Nothing else. Sorry to disappoint!
@cphillips_ippso @BBCNews I‚Äôm not the Gov. I‚Äôm an MP with a computer in a shared office upon which lives an email account. That‚Äôs as exciting as my computer gets
@IainDale I‚Äôm not !! What is it?

I would like to see th computer, the search history, and all the evidence before Damian Green is asked to fall on his sword. #justice

I‚Äôm sure if the computers of all MPs - including Labour ones, were investigated there would be a record of porn being accessed. There would, in all cases, be zero proof of who it was who accessed it.
@KarlPCaslin @BBCNews You don‚Äôt have a team of 4-6 staff answering the 300 emails you receive every day
Yes! I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs what we use as all staff have access to read my diary and one other has ability to amend and add https://t.co/NuHI6VfZz4

@Mr_Pragmatism That's why you were slow to tell me!
All staff send emails in our name. To say emails were sent at the same time porn was viewed - therefore it must have been him - is also preposterous
My staff log onto my computer on my desk with my login everyday. Including interns on exchange programmes. For the officer on @BBCNews just now to claim that the computer on Greens desk was accessed and therefore it was Green is utterly preposterous !!
Imagine if it was the phone of a black boy on the streets of Brixton that the officer had downloaded nine years ago - but, the boy had no access to anything with which to defend himself today, no phone, no records - just the word of the police officer talking on the radio https://t.co/OaNqBWMbcc

Donald Trump is not being invited to the U.K. The invitation is extended to the President of the USA. We respect the office, not the individual. It just so happens that previous occupants were also worthy of respect as individuals. Not anymore.

The culture that ‚Äòbabies lives don‚Äôt matter‚Äô as articulated here, is rooted in our attitude to late term abortion. It‚Äôs legal to abort a baby with club foot or similar, to the point of birth.

Absolutely no reason whatsoever why any MPs staff should work past 6pm.
Staff remain on Westminster premises drinking whilst MPs voting. Why? Plenty of pubs around London. No other workplace provides bars
Time for MPs staff to leave the premises at 6pm and for places like the sports and social club to be closed down. Westminster is a workplace
There is a cultural problem in Westminster. It‚Äôs complex. MPs who work late sharing restaurants /bars with young researchers who don‚Äôt.
