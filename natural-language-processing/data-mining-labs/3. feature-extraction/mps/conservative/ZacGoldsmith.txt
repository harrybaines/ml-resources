When @DouglasCarswell left the Cons he triggered a by-election because he recognised that despite his popularity, some voters had simply put a X in the Cons box.  It was the honourable thing to do. Looking at today‚Äôs possible Labour defectors, i‚Äôd be surprised if any did the same

@votemikeadams Yes. A huge shame.
@FreddieScovell Those issues pale in comparison with what we are doing to our word
Yes they could have done it in half term or a weekend, but it wouldn‚Äôt have triggered nearly as much coverage and debate. And that is the only point of a protest, surely.
If you accept that climate change is real, that we are causing it, and that it represents an existential threat, then complaining about kids missing a day of school to wake up their politicians seems spectacularly mean minded.

There will shortly be an Urgent Question in Parliament on Chris Chope‚Äôs appalling decision to block my and @MichaelBerkele2 ‚Äòs FGM Bill. Infuriatingly I am stuck in a Delegated Legislation Committee, but I hope there is a wave of cross party fury!
You‚Äôre unlikely to hear much about this because it‚Äôs not newsworthy.  MPs are unlikely to be lobbied about it because it‚Äôs not a voter priority (just 1 reason why it‚Äôs not a political priority either). But in the real world, this is the story that matters. https://t.co/QljpHSKhbS
Pressure grows to oust Christopher Chope after FGM law blocked | Society | The Guardian https://t.co/efALU7TnNi
@krishgm NB this article indicates what local Conservatives think of Chope‚Äôs behaviour: https://t.co/sJTMgZxREP
@krishgm I tried amending the Recall Bill to make it meaningful. I explained how it would/should work here: https://t.co/smtO1Lb2gg
@krishgm I don‚Äôt know. But it‚Äôs possible people were less aware of what he was getting up to - harder nowadays with social media.
@krishgm That said, the existence of safe seats is an argument for having a proper Recall system.
@krishgm ‚ÄòSafe seats‚Äô, where people only feel comfortable voting for one party, are safe only for the Party, not the MP. Doesn‚Äôt happen often but local Parties can and do change their candidates.

Chris Chope told @Telegraph he is in favour of the FGM legislation but "wanted it to be debated properly by MPs."  He knows very well that if he hadn't blocked it, we'd have had Committee Stage, Report Stage and Third Reading - all involving scrutiny and debate.
(In case anyone is tempted to believe he has a principled objection to Private Member‚Äôs Bills, please note that once again he did NOT object to those put forward by his friends.)
As anticipated, Chope objected to the FGM Bill. Just appalling.
@Howard_Goodall @BenGoldsmith I don‚Äôt want to bicker Howard, but this is also wrong. I‚Äôm not remotely miffed by what DT said! I just happen to think it was childish.
@Howard_Goodall @BenGoldsmith Hi Howard, I think you might have lost sight of your original argument. If your ‚Äònet‚Äô includes anyone who declared their voting intentions then you are proving my point! Bw, Zac
And if he is acting on principle, as he wants people to believe, why does he often allow Bills put forward by his friends to pass through unchallenged?  5/5
His argument is that he simply wants Bills properly debated. But it is a pretence. If today‚Äôs Bill goes through, we will have Committee Stage, Report Stage and Third Reading ‚Äì all of which involve scrutiny and debate. If it is blocked, there is no debate. 4/5
People ask why he would do such a thing (and indeed why he has similarly blocked motions to debate Hillsborough, pardon Alan Turing, ban the use oif wild animals in circuses, target ‚Äòupskirting‚Äô and much much more besides. 3/5
The Bill has been scrutinised fully in the Lords, and is supported now by Government.  Chope has been begged not to block it by FGM campaigners. 2/5
Today Chris Chope MP will once again use arcane procedure to block a Bill that would amend the 1989 Children Act to include FGM on the list of things (like forced marriage or domestic violence) for which the courts can issue protection orders if they think a child is at risk. 1/5
@charlottejones0 @NimkoAli . He doesn't object every time. He often allows Bills put forward by friends to pass through. That is how we know his arguments about procedure are a pretence. The only conclusion, as Nimco says, is that he doesn't give a stuff.
@Howard_Goodall Hello Howard. I wasn't involved in the referendum campaign, other than as a voter, like you. If Tusk was referring to me, then he was also condemning over 17m other Brits to Hell. My view, for what its worth, is that's a bit disproportionate and not very helpful.

The fact that in a narrow sense what BP is saying is true only demonstrates how flawed our economic system is - we attach no value to things we depend on (eg the planet), or costs to things that are so obviously destructive.

. @Jeremy_Hunt needs to sort this. We risk - on his watch - blowing all the progress and good will we have seen with the Blue Belt.
The FCO‚Äôs argument against providing full Marine protected status to the South Sandwich Islands (1m sq Kms) appears to be that there is no need as currently it is not fished. So do we wait for a fishing industry to move in (at which point it will be much harder)? Makes no sense.

Why do commentators still pretend the Muslim Council of Britain is representative? Only 6% of British muslims say it speaks for them (via Guardian).  Rejected by Lab&amp;Cons Home Secs for extremism, it has been complicit in (among other horrors) vile persecution of minority Ahmadis.

Time was restricted in the Heathrow debate &amp; I was given just 4 minutes to make the case against. Here is a transcript of the speech I would have given if I'd been able to: https://t.co/fUqAwq1o2G
10 years ago Parliament voted for Heathrow expansion; it never happened. The obstacles today are far bigger and the case for expansion is far weaker.  The vote was a disappointment, but Heathrow expansion remains undeliverable and it will not happen.
@mikebutcher Keep resigning over the same issue? That makes sense
I remember going to see the Government‚Äôs Infrastructure Minister, Lord Deighton to make the case against #Heathrow expansion.   9 months later he was the new Chairman of Heathrow.  #cronycapitalism
Heathrow is the most polluting, most disruptive, most expensive, most difficult to deliver option.  Govt admits the economic upside is lower than the main rival scheme, and provides the same connectivity.  And that it will damage regional airports.  Parliament has been hypnotised
As an MP for an area that will be massively affected by Heathrow expansion, it is absurd - perverse - that I had to cram my arguments into a 4 minute speech. Govt taking the piss.
Such a good speech by @JustineGreening  - forensic dismantling of the Heathrow expansion case. Clip to follow via @NoR3Coalition

Ie - The Transport Select Committee was always unthinkingly in favour of Heathrow expansion. But with a new Chair, they looked properly at the evidence. Their verdict is damning.
If there was a way to make MPs actually look at the evidence on this, the Heathrow NPS would - categorically - be rejected. https://t.co/UrXmL7G895

The Hamas PM said: ‚ÄúWe will take down the border and we will tear out their hearts from their bodies.‚Äù That's how Hamas sees this protest, even if some of our own MPs want to think of it as a Gandhian sit-in. It helps no one to pretend this is simple.

But what do the grandees think will happen if/when they overturn the vote? Do they think the 17+m will continue meekly voting for mainstream parties, even after their worst fears are realised?
Party leaders went out of their way to assuage the fears of ‚Äòparanoid‚Äô Brexiters that even if we voted out, we‚Äôd be kept in.  It‚Äôs increasingly looking like they were right.

@SachinPatel_87 @CarolineLucas @andree_frieze That‚Äôs very convenient but it is the party that decides if it is fielding a candidate, not the candidate. But even so- what is the argument against revealing the name of someone who offered an illegal bribe with a view to corrupting an election?
@SachinPatel_87 @CarolineLucas @andree_frieze That‚Äôs a bit silly Sachin. I‚Äôm sure if UKIP admitted being offered 250k to not stand, and then didn‚Äôt stand, you‚Äôd be up in arms demanding names etc. I‚Äôm also sure you don‚Äôt actually believe different parties should be held to different standards. Bw, Zac

Brilliant Energy Minister @TeamBluePerry on why renewables are rapidly taking over. https://t.co/Zr3sHy1I2D
I will be starting a debate on animal welfare policy at 11 in Westminster Hall. So much to praise, but more to do.
@jonathanlynn @NickHurdUK @michaelgove @RSPCA_official Not true. In the EU we can't stop live export of animals, reform the Common Agriculture Policy, ban products which don't meet our own animal welfare standards etc.
Here‚Äôs what is becoming a daily ‚Äòwell done‚Äô for @michaelgove. As @RSPCA_official have said, this will offer ‚Äústronger protection than Article 13 of the EU Treaty could ever do‚Äù. https://t.co/EPiKPmgg4Y

Just spotted in the Sunday Times. For what it‚Äôs Worth: 1- I haven‚Äôt had a conversation with Grant Shapps for years.  2- I received no press phone calls last night. 3- My ‚Äò4-year old‚Äô comments were not a reference to the PM. Other than that, spot on ST. https://t.co/yPUCAnL92m
We are ravaging the world's oceans, but we can reverse that if we want to. There's a chance now to protect the Antarctic - one of the world's last great wildernesses. Britain can lead the way @BorisJohnson  https://t.co/I2MXTBgPFE
@SimonAttwood Depends what you mean by 'we'. If you mean humanity, no. If you mean the UK, yes; we are doing more than any other country. And I hope we'll do much more again.
We can be proud that the UK is protecting nearly 4million square kms of ocean.  Now we need to protect the Antarctic.   https://t.co/I2MXTBgPFE

@AirportWatch @Benfogle @domdyer70 @DeborahMeaden @sueperkins Independent headline is characteristically weird and dishonest.  MPs voted against a specific amendment, not against the principle which all MPs from all Parties agree with. Govt does too. It will put forward its own amendment. It's not complicated.

@Benfogle @DeborahMeaden @JoshW066 @Independent That is a fair point. It could definitely have been addressed sooner.
@DeborahMeaden @JoshW066 @Benfogle @Independent It was a specific amendment that was rejected - not the principle. A better amendment will be introduced that will deliver the same outcome. It's not a conspiracy; it happens all the time. &amp; surely with Gove's record so far on animal welfare, he merits the benefit of the doubt.

@mrwilsunshine @KateHoeyMP . 'Hard brexit' is a typically misleading Lib dem construct, and largely bogus.

Vince is a slippery one. Says if he were in govt he'd have stopped arms exports to Saudi "a long time ago". He was, and signed off billions.

Theresa May rightly pays tribute to bravery of our police. We've protected police budget - Corbyn wants to cut it by 10% #BattleForNumber10
Too often Corbyn has sided with those that want to cause us harm rather than back Britain #BattleForNumber10
Genuinely scary thought that Corbyn could be our PM. He wants "more cuts" to our armed forces. How can we trust him to keep Britain safe?
