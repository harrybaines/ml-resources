@FraserNelson @DavidLammy David, didn’t you vote for the referendum in the first place?
@ClurryBurry @JohnSimpsonNews @iainmartin1 No most MP’s of all Parites don’t get it wrong. They probably get facts wrong much less than the average person. And if you spent lots of hours attending select committees and the debates no media bother to cover you would know that.
@JohnSimpsonNews So he got something wrong. It isn’t a reason to collectively slag off MP’s. When I was chair of the APPG IRAN group for 8 years you would some times spout utter drivel about that place. It didn’t make all foreign Correspondants rubbish because of it. @iainmartin1
@ronniecowan @ArfonJ @AssocPCCs @ukhomeoffice @sajidjavid @NorthWalesPCC @PoliceChiefs @wudzee0 @TransformDrugs @Release_drugs @alisonthewliss @LeanneWood In Netherlands drug deaths doubled between 2014 and 2016. One of the most liberal countries in EU on drugs still had active organised crime gangs ( we all do).
@ronniecowan @ArfonJ @AssocPCCs @ukhomeoffice @sajidjavid @NorthWalesPCC @PoliceChiefs @wudzee0 @TransformDrugs @Release_drugs @alisonthewliss @LeanneWood You might think you know about drugs but you clearly know nothing about organised crime. You keep campaigning to inflict the likes of Crack on our children and I will keep campaigning to put criminals behind bars.
@ArfonJ And Fentanyl?

@ArfonJ @AssocPCCs @ukhomeoffice @sajidjavid @NorthWalesPCC @PoliceChiefs @wudzee0 @TransformDrugs @Release_drugs @ronniecowan @alisonthewliss @LeanneWood You seem to have a lot to say on drugs so let me ask you would you legalise Crack? Yes or no?
@KateH123 @MrHarryCole No the Commons rejected Labours amendment by 53 including 6 Labour MP’s who voted with the Government and 29 who abstained
@DavidLammy No David but I have and I was there when the early foundations of the cease fire were laid in 1994. Using the Belfast Agreement as a Trojan horse for either side of the Brexit Argument is a disgrace. You are as guilty as the other side by exploiting it.
@DontDenyThe @UKgovcomms @AlexanderAiken You really are way off. I am sure you understand the amendment would block the US treaty happening and therefore we would be slowed/ prevented in getting vital data from US we need for child abuse investigations. FACT.
@DontDenyThe @UKgovcomms @AlexanderAiken Have you actually read the Bill or Labours amendment? If you had you will know it is an enabling bill that requires a bilateral treaty to be affective. The Labour amendment would scupper the treaty.
@bbclaurak Takes some doing to call a vote of no confidence and then loose by a bigger margin than the Governments working majority!
@NickBoles @DPJHodges But Nick it will have been “Parliament” that would have rejected the deal/ solution in the first place! Parliament seems very keen on what it doesn’t want but hopeless on what it does.  - Reminds me of Lords Reform!
@N68Winstan I think you will find it was the left that lost
@Dave_Loren @tnewtondunn @NickBoles @BBCr4today You will find it where Gordon Brown did...
@tnewtondunn @NickBoles Sorry Nick, none of us voted for Committee chairs to be the Excutive.  As you know their posts are Party allocated and they elected to scrutinise policy NOT to usurp the democratically elected Government @BBCr4today
@guy_masters62 @davidwford I believe that the deal does get you Brexit.  You can’t be “half pregnant”.
@Peston @BorisJohnson @theresa_may @Telegraph Deluded
@davidwford David my judgment is that if the deal fails you will be further away from what you want. That is my judgment. Let’s see who is right. If I am wrong vote for some one else.
@davidwford I can’t help the Parliamentary arithmetic. The Country voted the way it did in 2017. That is the reality. It is wishful thinking to believe that result didn’t have an effect on where we are today.
@davidwford David, if the deal dies No amount of “we should have done this or that” will change the outcome. It won’t be me doing it but My judgment is that it will not end the way you wish.
@davidwford David , wishful thinking won’t change the reality. If the deal is defeated it won’t matter what I do, the rebels, the Labour Party, SNP and Lib Dem’s will impose far far worse and you will never get the Brexit you want.  I believe the Deal gives you Brexit in the end.
Just a reminder about the different Brexit scenarios https://t.co/2dtTYiYyPQ
@MrHarryCole @johnmcdonnellMP @labourpress I think this guy has failed to spot Windrush started a long time under Labour....not long before they coined the phrase “hostile environment”
@neildhopwood @linkolanko @OwenPaterson I think I trust the current serving heads and other former leaders, NSA’s  and my own judgment than those two. Because security is about the here and now not about the past. Today we need to share and partner internationally. The deal helps continue that. FACT

@talygarntom @linkolanko @OwenPaterson Your point my have some credibility if I was actually in favour of reversing the referendum result. But I want to deliver Brexit. It might not be your way but I do believe the deal is the right way to achieve it. But what do you say to the current DG Mi5’s comments?
@linkolanko @DavidDavisMP Steven, you don’t have to agree with me but my views are based on the intelligence and operations I see every day.  Somethings will change with a Brexit and some won’t. But it is my honest opinion nothing to do with politics, ambition or anything else.
Great to meet with @JPN_PMO and his delegation at the UK-Japan Security Roundtable where we shared our experiences of successfully hosting the @London2012 Games to help Japan finalise preparations for their major upcoming sporting events https://t.co/vgDT2AkhZC
@linkolanko @OwenPaterson There has been a lot written about BrExIT and i take my job as security Minister incredibly seriously but Owen on this part you are totally wrong and wheeling out long retired, out of date, voices shows how little you understand the current threat.
@SamCoatesTimes Corbyn keeps threatening a “no confidence vote.”  Well go on then stop chickening about. Cluck cluck. Otherwise he and his front bench should get back to saying “our policy on Europe is absolutely clear” followed by total obfuscation.

While many were out enjoying themselves last nightTransport police &amp; GM police @BTP @gmpolice did a fantastic job containing the incident at Manchester Victoria Station. We should be proud our police, often unarmed, do what they do. @TerrorismPolice
&amp; commitment, will bring to justice those responsible for what are serious criminal acts that have caused disruption &amp; misery to thousands of passengers.Those people who choose to use drones recklessly or for criminal purposes can expect the most severe sentence when caught 4/4
As many of us are enjoying a Christmas break I would like to pay tribute to the police &amp; forces personnel who have come off leave to deal with this incident. I am confident that Sussex Police, who continue to lead this challenging investigation with the utmost professionalism 3/4
The huge proliferation of such devices,coupled with the challenges of deploying military counter measures into a civilian environment, means there are no easy solutions. However I can say that we are able to now deploy detection systems throughout the UK to combat this threat.2/4
As Gatwick starts to get back to normal it is important to make clear that Police, airport operators and armed forces personnel are totally focused on protecting the public and investigating the drone incursions that occurred last week.  1/4
@EdTechieTom Yes. And only 2 weeks ago key intelligence from another EU country foild a plot here. Proving a partnership is key to security not a narrow outlook.
@DougieGrant2 @WingsScotland Well you are right about one thing both BNP and Scots Nats are based on narrow nationalism.
@SaorAlba59 Yes muppet I was an msp - that’s “member of Scottish Parliament” if you can’t work it out

@Grouse_Beater I think you will find I Am Scottish
@dc_healey I doubt it by my answer on a second referendum would have been the same.
@auld_jethart Not a “Westminster Tory” but a Tory who started his politics as an MSP. And if you think the Scottish referendum was a positive experience then you need your head looking at
@davidwford At present we will be leaving the EU at the end of March David.
Only politicians who didn’t experience the deep division, anger &amp; nastiness of the tragic Scottish Indy Referendum would push for a second EU vote.  Because that is what it would be like. There was a “people’s vote”. Remainers like me lost. We need to move on not moan on.
I shall be supporting my PM today.  She is in the middle of trying to get the best for the UK.  At a time when security in the world is being tested I know more than most how well @theresa_may has dealt with real threats to our citizens.
@allisonpearson @BethRigby @AmberRuddHR It is never where you come from that matters - it is where you are going
@linkolanko @Econs4FreeTrade Yes read it. And had civil servants and lawyers in over last 2 weeks to explain every page and every question.  This around law enforcement &amp; investigations. It isn’t project fear to point out that if we leave without a deal then the tools we use will be restricted
@linkolanko @Econs4FreeTrade So please give me the facts why it would be more secure if went for exit without a deal in March......you can list them if you like...
@linkolanko @SamGyimah @afneil Sorry to disappoint you but this isn’t about ambition. I can not ignore the fact that without this deal our security WILL be worse off. That is a fact. I have spent the last 2 and half years dealing with the consequences of 5 terror attacks, and over 15 plots and Salisbury
@adrianadastra @FrankRGardner @Femi_Sorry Sorry you are wrong. Suggest you examine EU case law on the level required to exclude an EU citizen from the UK compared to the a citizen coming from a “third country”.
@Indigenous111 So in your expert opinion do you think we will be safer without access to data from Europe? Because I would love to see how you will maintain a watch list with passenger data.
@CricklewoodMum @The3Million I think you will find the legal test for excluding Eu Citizens ( and their dependents) are different than for non EU citizens.  The EU courts for instance have made rulings around past criminality etc. So perhaps you should be accurate.
@The3Million We only exclude people who pose a threat or are not conducive to the public good.  So your point is stupid
@YvetteCooperMP @SamCoatesTimes But we do get DNA, VRN and PNR details. And Para. 87 deals with the same data as SiS and Ecris plus by leaving EU I can now exclude some people who pose a threat who I couldn’t do now. That is a big plus for security.

@BradleyGJ Lol! Oh dear
@brengun66 @BradleyGJ @Aghanloo @cllrjohnkyle There is a lot to challenge Glenn about.
@BradleyGJ @brengun66 @Aghanloo @cllrjohnkyle Oh and I was a “remainer” but done let that get in the way of your ignorance
@BradleyGJ And you wouldn’t know a jot of what people did or did not know about the 1994 ceasefire so stop pretending you know all. Oh perhaps that’s the pretence of your offering....
@BradleyGJ I never said I was “box”. So don’t pretend I did. Nice try!
@georgenturner @IWTheDarkPrince Yes they were as was the fact PIRA were military defeated and their leadership knew that democrat legitimacy was the key not violence. But let’s plead not con ourselves that the EU or the border drove the peace plan.
@IWTheDarkPrince Yes like it’s success in sorting out Cyprus...not
@IWTheDarkPrince You must of forgotten Gordon Brown’s transactions with DUP....
@IWTheDarkPrince And you are wrong about the Whiskey. That product shows its possible to transit borders without checks at them as there are alternative methods.
@IWTheDarkPrince Yes but EU should be very careful wading into NI constitutional politics as it has 0 experience. But what ever is decided the “Troubles” won’t be reignited by a Brexit deal. There are far greater factors that drive that issue than single market/ Customs Union/ HardBrexit/ etc
I was actually an intelligence officer in Northern Ireland during the first ceasefire negotiations in 1994...I can’t remember the EU or Micheal Barnier or the Border being a factor in any of it....

Our new National Economic Crime Centre will be leading that response, using the full range of intelligence and tools and maximising new powers such as Unexplained Wealth Orders and Account Freezing Orders. 3/3

The UK has taken a leading role in the global fight against illicit finance and criminals should be in no doubt that we will come for them, their assets and their money, using all the powers we have at our disposal. 1/3
@thirstyworks @BrexitStewart Have you bought from amazon or eBay recently? You will see huge amount of small business trade from US &amp; outside EU. Small businesses often engage in transactions below customs thresholds. E.g you only pay customs duty if value over £120. Simpler than some want to make out
@Sliother @JP_Biz @steve_hawkes @KateHoeyMP @astley_ben Yes and how good was the internet at that time Or the online package/ cargo tracking? You do no that the world of technology has changed a lot since then?
@JP_Biz @steve_hawkes @KateHoeyMP @astley_ben Also as some one who actually once patrolled the border,  people should know that firstly the hard border of the past (it wasn’t really hard apart from the big crossings anyway) was because of security threats NOT trade!
@JP_Biz @steve_hawkes @KateHoeyMP @astley_ben You will need to ask the Brexit team. My point is that for decades we have traded goods across the border that have had different duty rates (before any EU!) and so if we can do it now we can do it in the future.
@KateHoeyMP @astley_ben Every week Whiskey and Guinness cross the NI / Irish border. They both have different duty rates north &amp; south. They aren’t stopped at the border. they pay duty either before they leave or at bonded warehouses.  Beware those trying to exploit people’s ignorance of what already is
Much of the solutions to the Irish Border lie in this great product of Northern Ireland https://t.co/69vSvb3xMx
great work by Dutch Intelligence, UK and International partners to expose more Russian GRU malign operations. The exposed Cyber ops reveals that no country is respected when it comes to their activities.
@StephenWFLabour Thanks for confirming you were clearly not present during the court case.
@EddieThorntonUK @MiketodmanM @DerbyChrisW @DPJHodges Er...that’s a bit of spin!
@maxblunt @DerbyChrisW Sorry but the conversation was all about “democracy”.  On Fracking we aren’t going to agree.
@timspencer1 @StephenWFLabour @DerbyChrisW @Conservatives I think you should listen to the accounts of those who were actually subject to the protest. They didn’t find it “peaceful”
@JoeMurphyLondon Socialists: “do as I say not as I do”
@timspencer1 @StephenWFLabour @DerbyChrisW @Conservatives You of course all assume the protest was peaceful and not intimidating. If it was do you think they should be jailed -  ever?
@StephenWFLabour I would recommed you actually listen to the full details of the case before making huge sweeping statements.  The only people who know the full facts will be the judge/jury and the lawyers who say through the whole thing.
@jclarekneebone @DerbyChrisW No they haven’t
@MiketodmanM @DerbyChrisW @DPJHodges But a democratically elected government did say fracking could happen ( and beat Labour) but to you that doesn’t seem to count. You anti frackers all the same. A la carte democracy!
@DerbyChrisW Answer the question Chris. What about housing? You say local democracy should trump all except when it applies to Labour policy. A bit like your second referendum joke. A second referendum if your not in power but not if you are.
@MiketodmanM @DerbyChrisW @DPJHodges Yes but if you were in government and a local council voted to allow fracking would you uphold it.
@DerbyChrisW So Chris if Labour win power will local councils be able to stop planning permissions and local inspectors and Minister will not be able to intervene? How will you then meet your housing target?
@MiketodmanM @DerbyChrisW @DPJHodges In North Yorkshire the council voted for fracking permission. Should it be allowed to go ahead then there? Or does democracy only work when it supports your views?
@MiketodmanM @DerbyChrisW @DPJHodges Probably the same will as the electorate who voted Conservative in both my constituency and Fylde. So as our manifesto was pro fracking your argument is slightly undermined
@theRealRayThomp Strictly
@DerbyChrisW @DPJHodges Noticed none of them actually live in Lancashire. #anyprotestwilldo
@DerbyChrisW @DPJHodges They weren’t Chris they were breaking the law. And don’t give it the local people line. It is my constituency and the neighbouring one are the area affected. The vast majority of the objections came from outside the County including from Australia!
@theRealRayThomp Oh please! Conservative PM Benjamin Disraeli and Winston Churchill might disagree with you! Oh who is this? Any guesses...clue he was a senior Labour MP https://t.co/yxOkXGDziN
@Twiz007 @bbcnickrobinson I’m not claiming the high ground on this I assure you. just wanted to understand the news today on this issue
@bbcnickrobinson Could some one clarify Labour’s EU position for me. Will Labour only give people a vote on the Brexit deal if they aren’t in power? If they are they won’t?
@christopherhope @Telegraph Oh please! Did they go to the same tin foil hat academy as Corbyn’s Andrew MURRAY?
@Unwariest Probably takes one to know one
@ChelleHBentley Let’s start with the highest people in employment ever which compares much better than young people’s chances in most of EU . Followed by starting to getting the state to live within its means so young people won’t have to spend their adult life paying off labours debts.
Anyone who thinks we are going to call an election needs their head seeing to! The longer we govern, the longer the public get to see the Looney left alternative in full. Brexit is Brexit. Racist, hate-fuelled momentum Trots is the biggest threat to UK.
@BenPBradshaw @NCA_LynneOwens Yes and I will BEN . To say this is bollocks is an understatement.

@NewStatesman @MariaWNorris I have read your article and there are indeed some valid points but you are wrong about sense of urgency of tackling far right/neo-nazi threat.  And for the record I condemned the Finsbury Park Mosque attack as terrorism within hours.
@RichardBenyonMP You some how have included the word “useful” Richard. Must be a typo
@mikeCoppockUK @mattmars @jeremycorbyn Nice try but we don’t need distractions.  I suggest you face the reality  of “who” and “what” the  Leader of the Labour Party has supported.
@mikeCoppockUK @mattmars @jeremycorbyn I think you will find the whole of your statement is incorrect
@jeremycorbyn No Jeremy inviting IRA members to the Commons weeks after the Brighton Bomb is as about as low as you can get
@OliverBullough I know you might be impatient to get this progressed and so am I but as you will know converting intelligence into evidence, developing cases that reach the CPS threshold and tracking down the money does actually take time.  We don’t do it the Russian way.

@AndyEdwardsR14C @DannyShawBBC @PA @Gatwick_Airport @JeremyVineOn5 ....er I didn’t. If you listen to the debate I said that I could speculate that because the Russian state suppprted the attack on Salisbury the authorities in Russia probably didn’t search the GRU bags too closely!

@GuzKhanOfficial @sajidjavid You would love me to leave History aside because that way you can paper over the fact that Labour have always bust the country and left the poor to carry the burden.  And now you chose to call people who disagree with you some sort traitors!

The two individuals are officers from the Russian military intelligence, the GRU. The GRU is a highly disciplined organisation with a well-established chain of command. This was not a rogue operation. It was almost certainly also approved at a senior level of the Russian state

Before everyone rushes to unfairly condemn our lntelligence services for things that happened over a decade ago we should remember that every day they risk their lives to keep us safe.They are the best in the world. Doing a lot with a little against foes that do not obey any laws
@BainesSchool great to meet the fantastic leadership team at Baines this morning. I look forward to supporting headteacher Alison Chapman and her staff in the future
@9546ec @JXB101 @AlexCruttwell @NSoames The exposure the whole of Airbus has to the A400 m project alone is catastrophic for it’s balance sheet.  Airbus will still need us and we will still need Airbus for a long time to come
@RichardBentall @dlghill @Airbus @GeorgeFreemanMP No I see the clear facts. For example outside Germany the UK is BMW’s biggest European market and only 3% behind the US.  We buy nearly 3 times as many BMW’s as the French and other EU countries.  For that reason it is not in BMW’s interest to see the EU erect barriers
@RichardBentall @dlghill @Airbus @GeorgeFreemanMP Depends which model of Airbus you are talking about to be precise
@dlghill @Airbus @GeorgeFreemanMP It would be rather stupid for a Buisness to bite the hand that feeds it.
@dlghill @Airbus @GeorgeFreemanMP It isn’t anti business to point out that the UK is a deep invested partner in Airbus. That means the so called threats are rather hollow.
@AlexCruttwell @NSoames You read it so wrong and I am afraid demonstrate a ignorance of how complex items are manufactured and the world of tarrifs.
@AlexCruttwell @NSoames No one said ban ! You need to understand how access to markets work and how inter dependency works in industrial supply chains
@PoliticalJenga Do come. You can explain your “loathsome” clap trap as well. Look forward to it.
@Dai_James1942 Not just not great, Bn of € over and years late!
@nickyjanem @CatSmithMP @PaulMaynardUK @leponline @The_Gazette Yes and my constituents voted to LEAVE the EU!
@PoliticalJenga Who are you?
When I last checked if it wasn’t for the customer countries of the A400m , Airbus would have not been able to cover the over budget and delays.  Aerospace manufacturers need customers. Perhaps they might reflect on that
@raefil ...what a load of twaddle. People voted for Brexit not a party “and you know it” . I shall do my best to get the best deal for the UK.
Michel Barnier playing “ Russian Roulette” with EU citizens security is a foolish thing to do. Security is NOT a competition- it is for all our mutual benefits.

@__o0OOOO0o__ @WillBaldet Oh dear! Poor you
@__o0OOOO0o__ @WillBaldet Your answer shows more than anything you don’t understand tech nor what is possible and not possible nor what most governments have required of TELCO’s for years. I’d go back to tech school if I was you
@__o0OOOO0o__ @WillBaldet Encrypted or end to end encrypted? One would be possible and another would not as I am sure you know.
@davidwford @GuidoFawkes Too true
@bricksilk Congratulations David. Thank you for the constructive and principled way in which you held us all to account.
@__o0OOOO0o__ @WillBaldet I never asked for a work around of end to end. I said there is a cost and challenge to keeping people safe because of end to end and we need to find ways of recouping that. I know we can’t “uninvent” the tech
@AndyJSykes Andy, usually speak with Fiona Finch at the papers. So is Tom covering same patch?
@AndyJSykes Always happy to speak to local media Andy. How can I help?
@raefil @YouTube @SideshowKen What with record employment levels, and a reduced deficit? Takes time to sort Labour mess out. Always does.
Here’s reality check for all the Corbynistas: Tracey Ullman - Labour Under Corbyn Won the Election. Watch https://t.co/n3ZEC72cqu via @YouTube @SideshowKen
@youngian67 @LancasterForEU Lancaster is my local town. I won it from Labour in 2005. So I know my Town well.
@LancasterForEU And there is nearly 4 years till the next General Election!
@LancasterForEU Looks like a Venezuelan socialist poll to me rather than a proper sample
@LancasterForEU Not of course how they voted at the referendum.
@LushLtd What a desperate and pathetic campaign. The vast majority of undercover police officers risk their own safety to keep people safe. It is not an easy job but without them vital intelligence would not be available to put criminals behind bars. @BBCDomC
@gmpolice One of the most saddening thing about the Kerslake report into the response was the behaviour of the media. The BBC should know better. “Manchester police boss slams inaccurate Arena bombing BBC documentary https://t.co/B9DnOs9ILa via @MailOnline”
@V4Vendetta5Nov @Tim_R_Dawson No opposition party in living memory has won a general election without first being the biggest party in local government so let’s look at the figures as of today: Conservative
@IoWBobSeely @TomTugendhat Interesting trail on your report Tom but you failed to ask the Minister for economic crime and lead on money laundering to give evidence. Also remember until we leave the EU we can’t impose “unilateral” sanctions in the same way the US can.
I can categorically say that the Times story today about Action Fraud / NFIB’s algorithmic triage system for dealing with reports from victims is untrue and plain wrong @thetimes @cityoflondon @CityPolice
@iainmartin1 And even they have passports!
@scousemeow @andrewwwilson Yes I work for my constituents NOT the Edinburgh Labour Party.
@dylanhm Says it all about you. Sad really.
@montie @allan_mallinson “ Those who promise us paradise on earth never produced anything but a hell” - Karl Popper
@Smellma_pits @Holbornlolz Your right but every Stalinist was a Marxist
@andrewwwilson It’s probably Andrew that you were busy being chair of Edinburgh Labour students and I was busy dealing with constituents facing pressing problems. I put constituents casework before Labour grandstanding!
Conservatives take control of Pendle https://t.co/9ubr87AsEA via @BBCNews
@GMB @DPJHodges @HackneyAbbott So Labour coined “hostile environment” and Abbott supports targets.  I think the public will be confused!
During the awful attacks last year Amber Rudd helped steer her department and the security services though difficult times. Few Ministers are ever tested that way. We should not forget that record. It has been a privilege to work with her.
Currently in Toronto attending the G7 Security Ministers meeting. My thoughts are with all those caught up in the incident today in this fine City. #G7
My thoughts are with the family and friends of those that are reported to have been invlolved in an accident in Saudi Arabia
Just leaving the West Wing https://t.co/wlE3ShViKs
So House of Commons voted to support the Syria action and the PM when it came to consulting MP’s.  Can we all get on with the job and let Jeremy C get back to his protests because he isn’t going to be PM by Christmas! (Or last Christmas)
@djfoggo @PippaCrerar @NeilGrayMP Fair point.
@bricksilk @bbclaurak Sadly too true
@Peston @philippesands Of course Robert the difference between Iraq and Syria is that there is current use of chemical weapons AND a humanitarian disaster as a result of them. Major difference.
@mostafatherebel And you have proof of that? Or is this the view from your armchair?
@chrisinsilico I have just read it. If offences were committed then I am sure the appropriate authorities will look at prosecution. I am pretty keen to find out who was behind spending millions on the remain campaign and still we lost!!
Corbyn , Abbott and Labour should reflect that this action in Syria took place because the first time Assad gassed his own people they voted to do nothing. So he did it again..and again. Yet still Corbyn would do nothing...
@AudioSpyder No i don’t. I see evidence of groomers targeting some with Autism.
@V4Vendetta5Nov It might of missed your attention but Jeremy Corbyn didn’t win the election, he wasn’t the PM by Xmas &amp; the next election is not due for over 4 yrs. So JC runs nothing and is responsible for delivering nothing in Gov. So he doesn’t get to chose. #JClost
@RichPizan3 Nerve agent is an area weapon. If it had been delivered by aerosol or by a burst then it would have affected hundreds. I suspect you are the ignorant one otherwise you would know the dangers of chemical weapons.
@NSoames They are getting desperate. Having massively lost their own OPCW vote Russia now demands to know the fate of the family pets as they hold “vital clues”.
@Lizzyiris1963 @jennyjmilton @AmberRuddHR @LauraPidcockMP @DurhamPolice You made up your mind about Tories years ago and of course it is all a big capitalist conspiracy in attempt to hide the fact man never landed on the moon and Stalin was really a loveable communist! Oh yes and money grows on trees especially other peoples...
@Lizzyiris1963 @jennyjmilton @AmberRuddHR @LauraPidcockMP @DurhamPolice Conspiracy theory wacko alert!
@Lizzyiris1963 @jennyjmilton @AmberRuddHR @LauraPidcockMP @DurhamPolice I think it was a bit of both. The UK entered recession before the banking crisis and Gordon Brown got the regulation balance wrong. Plus Labour inherited in 97 a budget that delivered a zero deficit.
@jennyjmilton @AmberRuddHR @LauraPidcockMP @DurhamPolice You are having a laugh? There is no tradition of a Chancellor spending all the money! Hang on...yes Labour chancellors usually do....
@Lizzyiris1963 @jennyjmilton @AmberRuddHR @LauraPidcockMP @DurhamPolice No they don’t! Who told you that?
@jennyjmilton @AmberRuddHR @LauraPidcockMP @DurhamPolice From Labour’s own hand....believe all the banking conspiracies you like but that won’t pay Labour’s debt or close the deficit https://t.co/kd6V3wv5Am
@Jodyw2009 @MirrorPolitics @eddieizzard The fact you tried to equate the two shows how warped your values must be
@Jodyw2009 @MirrorPolitics @eddieizzard Not the same at all as hate and threats sent by momentum followers at all. E.g You can disagree with Isreal Gov actions without  being anti-semetic, or disagree with an Women MP without being misogynistic.
@MirrorPolitics @eddieizzard And will you equally pledge to root out the hate and Misogyny dished out by many of the same in momentum and Labour?
@BARREST74 @TheCriminalBar @BarristerSecret Yes I shall of course read it
@jennyjmilton @AmberRuddHR @LauraPidcockMP @DurhamPolice Yup that was when the Government wasn’t paying billion of pounds to pay off Labour’s debts
@MrHarryCole Is this a spoof account?
@wallaceme @JournoStephen She must mean the “North” as in Lapland because when I last looked there are plenty of Jewish people In my region!
@LauraPidcockMP @DurhamPolice I think I do Laura, the CC is one of my constituents. Unlike you Laura, I actually served alongside the police at a time your leader was inviting the IRA to tea
@masterpaul43 You know Labour’s dossier that took the UK to war on Iraq.  - WMD
@masterpaul43 Didn’t answer the Labour dodgey dossier question? Have you forgotten?
@masterpaul43 Wasn’t the “Tories” that produced the dodgey dossier- it was Labour or have you forgotten than
So after the Government, NATO, EU, USA , and Canada all attribute the Salisbury attack to Russia  , Corbyn finally and reluctantly agrees. 21 days on from the attack. - “The worm has turned” as the saying goes.
Europe, the USA and Canada unite to stand up to the Russian Government’s unacceptable behaviour. A good day for the upholding of the rule of law, the solidarity of allies and for HMG
@Rubs1 Happy to answer your questions. Did you send me an email?
https://t.co/oEdpLm6nes
@bbcnickrobinson A misleading article. The Government have always said we would do magnitsky legislation.  I did  first half in Criminal finance act. Labour front bench were almost invisible on it. Andrew Mitchell MP &amp; Margret Hodge MP have been true Campaigners on it. Not grandstanding Corbyn
@whackfrost @AmberRuddHR @carolinenokes @NickHurdUK Total bollocks!
@watchitlad @1wabbit1 He clearly expressed his view to the Iranian Government on our visit his concerns on human rights abuses.
@watchitlad @1wabbit1 JC and I may disagree on many things but that doesn’t mean he should be criticised for something he didn’t do
@afneil I can Andrew I was on the trip. He raised human rights abuses including of journalists and I raised abuses of minority’s such as the Baha’i community
@EuroGuido @GuidoFawkes No it doesn’t
@mathsisfun @Cumpedelibero @MarcusStead So we are agreed - Labour spent too much and failed to regulate the city correctly in the lead up to the banking crisis.
@mathsisfun @Cumpedelibero @MarcusStead And to balance the books a government has to balance cutting spending and putting up taxes?
@mathsisfun @Cumpedelibero @MarcusStead But let me ask. Do you think Labour spent too much during it’s last spell in Government?
@mathsisfun @Cumpedelibero @MarcusStead The roots of the crash happened before Lehman’s in Sep 08 but having launched into their own spending plans years before Labour had no room to weather the storm. Indeed even when it happened they did little to control public spending instead preferring to borrow
@mathsisfun @Cumpedelibero @MarcusStead “I want us to do even more to encourage the risk takers” (Gordon Brown, Mansion House speech, 17 June 2004). -
@mathsisfun @Cumpedelibero @MarcusStead I think you will find the surplus years where when they stuck to the Conservative spending plans from 97. Also UK started into recession approx 6 months before Banking collapse.
@Cumpedelibero @MarcusStead Unlike the left’s plan it was accompanied by growth and growing employment. In the end spending every year more than you had, even when the economy was strong, was going to come back and haunt the UK. You are right to be angry but be angry with the Labour Gov who spent it all
@Andreadamson4 @MarcusStead Yes I feel trapped between never ending BrExit stories!

@AlecMuffett 1.) quicker than they do now. We have managed to reduced time already but we know it can be done quicker. 2.) please expand “due process” point?
@JonBHunter It didn’t. We all have a responsibility to contribute to a safer society. Citizens, business, government and law enforcement. Or are you saying we don’t?
@futureidentity @AlecMuffett Both
@_ginger_kid We are not asking for more powers just better compliance.  Most of the CSP are already overseas for tax reasons rather than philosophical reasons!
@ijb19662 @BBCNews On that I completely agree
@_ginger_kid It is just as much about organised crime and child abuse. All of which use encryption and online grooming in the same way terrorists do.
@_ginger_kid Problem is pedophilles exploit that right to abuse and this “State” is democratic, oversighted, accountable and held to the rule of law by an independent judiciary. So in some circumstances law enforcement should be able to seek content or other data. Or do you disagree?
@_ginger_kid And of course our preference would be to get access to content when properly oversighted and warranted. But we know what could be possible and what it not
@_ginger_kid There is more to data than just content as I am sure you know
@_ginger_kid And we do work with the industry but they could do a lot more.
@_ginger_kid I think you won’t see anywhere in the interview me calling for backdoors into end to end encryption.

@ic56man @iainmartin1 No I know exactly what socialism is. It is what idiots do with other people’s money.
@ic56man @iainmartin1 The sovereign wealth fund invests in the “private, profit making sector”. Not really a socialist activity. Venezuela didn’t invest but loved the socialist dream!! Lots of spivs there. Same type of spivs that say socialist work...but give us all your money first!
@ic56man @iainmartin1 Norway is run by a conservative government. Amazingly add that to oil and you get a rich country. Where as when you add oil + socialism in Venezuela you get.....poverty! Well done mate! P.S Qatar just bought some Lancashire made planes!

@Tims_r_us Well unlike Corbyn I didn’t take £20 k from the Iranian State. But if you know anything about Iran you will know that they use detention as leverage. This is not about words but about what IRAN wants from UK.
@AlvinClarke04 Yes. I have made strong representation to Network Rail and Northern Rail. It is totally unfair and wrong how Le Feast has been treated.
@JoeMurphyLondon Any one who knows anything about Iran knows it is not a few words that condem. Iran has used detention as a bargaining tool for decades
@BBCDomC But that doesn’t mean they are abandoned or forgotten about
@BBCr4today The Criminal finance act also includes extra territorial tax evasion offences and anti-money laundering offences.

@pauljebb1 @nadams @charliedewhirst Why did Laura Kuensberg need protection at the Labour Conference?

@Ellpne @raefil @pneonline Er...I don't vote on plans ..the council do.
@raefil @helen_xxxx @ingolwhite @pneonline So can I just get some clarity? If this was not about PNE would you support building more houses on open spaces in preston?
@raefil @helen_xxxx @ingolwhite @pneonline Phil, there are dozens of right of ways accross the area many of which would be blocked
@helen_xxxx @raefil @ingolwhite @pneonline The council passed the local plan that wants it to remain open space. That was passed by an all party vote.
@marknlou @Crazy_DavidP So as long as it is about house buildings that's ok is it? Stuff the residents? Your the one being played by the developer
@helen_xxxx @raefil @ingolwhite @pneonline I am not against the ground but the way this has come about is not fair on the residents &amp; I regularly speak with PNE.
@raefil @helen_xxxx @ingolwhite @pneonline If a separate company built the ground they could lease it to the club
@helen_xxxx @ingolwhite @raefil @pneonline And who is profiting from the houses? The club?
@helen_xxxx @ingolwhite @raefil @pneonline I'll check out the rules on Monday with the FA and let's see. There are many ways it can be done
@helen_xxxx @ingolwhite @raefil @pneonline Why not? Are you saying the owners don't have the money?
@marknlou @Crazy_DavidP The training ground was passed just not the houses
@ingolwhite @raefil @pneonline The ground was PASSED but not the houses.
@Ellpne @raefil @pneonline I have no agenda against the owner at all. If it was really about the club not the houses the last applications would have had the ground
@raefil @pneonline ..The blue comes the training ground. The developer has all the land &amp; money already to build a training ground. No need for houses. 3/3
@raefil @pneonline ..gimmick to try and get more houses built on the golf course. The owner has three times had application rejected for houses so out of ..2/3
@raefil @pneonline Phil, the thing is I have been involved with local residents about Ingol for over 6 years. The PNE training ground is a last min cheap 1/3

@365Battles I am not making a political point. I was asked why I didn't support the amendment. I gave a reason.  Nothing to do with party politics

@Bathacademic Some effort -  you could always resign rather than spout lecturing tweets from the salaried comfort of the industry partners
@Bathacademic See your pay master's industry partner is Bae and Rolls Royce. Keep taking the money!

"The IRA bombing campaign was completely wrong because it was taking CIVILIAN lives"  -Jeremy Corbyn 27/5/17 - so ok when killing police?
@Bathacademic @DJWarburton Do you mean Jeremy Cornyn who told Andrew Neil he never met the IRA? Because that was a rock solid lie
I am so proud of our North West police and emergency services for they way they have responded. @gmpolice
It has been a privilege to have been briefed today by the men &amp; women of Greater Manchester Police on the terrorist attack last night.
In light of the attack in Manchester tonight please be vigilant &amp; if you see anything suspicious call the anti-terrorist hotline 0800789321
My thoughts are with all the victims of the incident tonight &amp; our emergency services who are out there tending wounded &amp; keeping us safe
@KelvyKelv @jeremycorbyn Because some wanted to use force not democracy to change the constitutional settlement
@KelvyKelv @jeremycorbyn He did not condemn the IRA and he equates them to the British Army
@Davidm1969 Keep kidding yourself on! Better for you that way I think!
@Davidm1969 No.9 is pure fantasy of deluded, excuse making terrorist sympathisers. The IRA didn't come to the peace table because of Corbyn.
@Davidm1969 Nearly three quarters of the list is utter bollocks.  You can be pro-Irish unity and anti Terrorist you know - the SDLP.

@Bathacademic @marwan18 @RiseUp75 Unlike you I don't take money from an institution that teaches aerospace and takes research funds.
@JamesSorah Well done! he has donated to healthcare to set up a world class rehabilitation centre for soldiers but he has not donated to the Tory Party
@Bathacademic @marwan18 @RiseUp75 Why do you take money from a University that teaches a specific course in "aerospace engineering"? If you are so bothered?
@Bathacademic @marwan18 @RiseUp75 Immensely proud to have BAE workers in my constituency they help develop &amp; manufacture world leading technology &amp; create wealth to fund NHS

@chrisneill No sorry it was to the retweeter not you. I think you and I are not going to agree on the substance. But thanks for the offer
@chrisneill Except I didn't remove the tweet!
The question for Corbyn and McDonnell is not their view of a united Ireland but why they chose the IRA over democratic SDLP?
@chrisneill Let's see when you next have a women MP as leader or who doesn't think Gay sex is a sin.
@sxybio @chrisneill Except it was Tory Prime Minister, not Nick Clegg who pushed Gay Marriage. Nor the Labour Government of 13 years
@sxybio @chrisneill Most of the Lib dems are now ex-MP's!
@sxybio @chrisneill How many times ...they already had equal rights!
@chrisneill The civil partnership vote was before 2005 when I entered politics. I would have voted for it. Because stable relationships are what matter
@sxybio @chrisneill For the record I don't think Gay people are sinners or that they are any less worthy of equality. What does Tim Farron think?
@sxybio @chrisneill homophobic -adjective having or showing a dislike of or prejudice against homosexual people. - I don't and I am not. End
@sxybio @chrisneill Lib dems MP for Burnley also voted against.
@chrisneill Also totally wrong
@chrisneill I didn't remove the tweet
@Carter_AndrewJ @hiyerjayne Secondly can you tell me what was the actual difference between a civil partnership &amp; a marriage in the eyes of the law?
@Carter_AndrewJ @hiyerjayne Firstly the gay marriage vote was not about "rights" as gay couples already had equality before the law.
@hiyerjayne I don't think so. Voting against Gay marriage doesn't make anyone homophobic.
@hiyerjayne And the facist tweet please. Twitter is not an excuse for abuse
@hiyerjayne You should remove both your racist and homophobic allegations please. They are libellous
@hiyerjayne You didn't say that when you emailed me last year. Could you please withdraw your allegation of Racism?
@hiyerjayne What evidence do you have I am a racist? If you don't have any please remove this tweet
@hiyerjayne I would be delighted to help you with your problem please email me at wallaceb@parliament.uk

@critchyboy @OccasionalBerk Do you wish a second referendum? Or to disrespect the result?

@flybe in control is not the same as having your own employees able to communicate direct with head office
@flybe it is the airline who decides whether it is going to hand everything over to their handling agents or keep some of their own
@flybe Will passengers for the BE472 flight be put on the recently landed BE473 or will you do the usual trick of merging next 2 flights?
@flybe When will you beef up staff presence at Manchester?
@flybe another Manchester morning stuck in Airport as Flybe constantly change dep time. Impossible to find an employee let alone and answer
Mcdonnell is pro-IRA, Livingstone excuses suicide bombers, Abbott says Mao's good out weighs the Millions murdered - Labour 2015! Sickening

@VirginTrains thank you all at Virgin for finding my lost bag tonight. A great asset to the West Coat and the North
@sam_lister_  yes Sam and I also bet he would repeatedly rule out leading the in campaign
@Refracktion yes because the election results showed how popular hard left wing policies are
@raefil sorry Phil the trots had the black flags &amp; masks, the Labour activists had "i've voted Corbyn" badges. They're running the show now
Dear Trot,Anarchist &amp; Labour activists who spat, yelled &amp; swore at us during #CPC2015.You're the best recruiting sergeant we could ever have

@tomcoady @J_Donaldson_MP get your facts right. It was the conservatives in the 90's that started the process that led to 94 ceasefire
@paulwaugh you will notice he didn't condemn the IRA &amp; nor did Corbyn during the leadership contest. it wasn't an apology it was an excuse
In the last 2 months both Corbyn and McDonnell have failed to take the opportunity to condemn the IRA
McDonnell's comments on the IRA tonight were missing condemnation of them. It wasn't an apology it was an excuse @bbcquestiontime
@paulwaugh during leadership contest repeatedly refused to condemn IRA. Leadership views current not just back in time
@jordcaramell @robvanriot yes in order to keep you and our freedoms safe
@LucyMPowell congratulations Lucy! well deserved.
@IvanLewis_MP @DPJHodges Sorry to see you go. Thank you for your bipartisan approach &amp; support of the political process.
@MBRoberts4OO4 you must have missed the employment figures for the last 5 yrs!
@robvanriot i support many of my constituents who belong to trade unions but they are too often lions led by donkeys like McCluskey
@robvanriot sticking up for the defence industry and the thousands of jobs in it directly is linked to the thousands of Bae jobs in my const
@HelenJqRimmer it is this gov that has reformed the renewable market place thru CFD's and also invested in nuclear skills not Labour
@HelenJqRimmer @FredianiITV not really worked on those when i worked for the UK's largest Research and Tech company so know exact difference
@HelenJqRimmer @FredianiITV i venture building a nuclear attack sub requires much more people and skills than a wind mill
Dear Barrow in Furness, Labour have just elected a man who will close the sub yards and put thousands out of work
Labour peer and Climate Change activist speaking sense on fracking this morning on Radio 4 today
UK Gov stands by those from war torn Syria http://t.co/I3pEdHa2KL
Labour campaign for Lancs to retain rights over mineral planning but are against retaining any revenues from NW natural resources!
@LabourWPN brilliant so you want NW retain the right to say yes or no over fracking but not to retain any revenues from its resources!

@gordonkerfuffle good bye!
@gordonkerfuffle not interested in getting Ombudsman minimum would like more for my constituents. Go back  to your golf

@E_VDG as long as the AA's adhere to the flexibility it is right that the professionals who do the teaching can use their  judgement

@kevinsmithcronx @Prah14mat @RDut24 where in the end parent and head disagrees who do you believe should have final say?
@kevinsmithcronx @Prah14mat @RDut24 i have made a number of requests on behalf of constits. some times with success.
@E_VDG @sb_campaign AA &amp; heads can have the flexibility to depart from entry rules if they agree with parent child needs delay
@MBRoberts4004 @ConversationUK tories started way before 1945 to improve access to general practice
@E_VDG please see original letter sent. I want flexibility but i also want heads &amp; AA to play a part http://t.co/0BARvC97Y5
@Sue_A_Wright my first letter was clear. There is flexibility in system for admin. I believe AA &amp; heads should have a role in deciding.
@Prah14mat @kevinsmithcronx @RDut24 perhaps you should read all correspondance before rushing to condemn http://t.co/4IL0YGuoQ8
@kevinsmithcronx @Prah14mat @RDut24 lets be clear. i want flexibility in system to allow children to enter diff years. That flex is there
@Prah14mat @kevinsmithcronx @RDut24 perhaps you should see all the correspondance before you make such comments

@Labour_BenW Being an ‘absentee candidate’ has not helped Mr Whittingham’s campaign.” Recognise the quote? From your own Labour activist
@Labour_BenW 2 and a half years.
@Labour_BenW oh and Scorton isn't in the constituency you stood in.
@Labour_BenW 15 years living here, 3 children born here, schooled here. worked in aerospace. Think have enough connection
@Labour_BenW i'll tell my cousins on the Fylde that. they will be pleased.
@raefil @Labour_BenW @jeremycorbyn jeremy is an honest and decent man not a member of the SPADOCRACY
@Labour_BenW Cat Smith will say why not you?
@Labour_BenW we don't actually have a leadership contest as we have a winning PM. when we do I promise to say who I will support.
@Labour_BenW come on Ben! You should lets know what leader you want as you might be an MP. There is no secret ballots for us.
@Labour_BenW who did you vote for? 1st and 2nd pref Ben?
@BWolstenholm please email me at: wallaceb@parliament.uk; happy to discuss the issue
@ceterisparibusy that is a matter for Labour and their members. They decide the rules, the candidates and ultimately the leader.
@catterallwhite @unitedutilities not for long i understand and you will be compensated I hope
Good news that restrictions on Poultry farms in Lancashire have been lifted today. Farmers, NFU &amp; local DEFRA should be congratulated
@ceterisparibusy I never said I agreed with his politics or even his causes.
@TomDavies_golf i couldn't agree more.
The arrogance of Corbyn's rivals that only Westminster bubble MP's could lead Labour Party is perhaps why so many members want the opposite
Corbyn &amp; I visited Iran together last year. He is an honest left winger who genuinely likes people. The other candidates should look &amp; learn
Pleased to have met, yesterday, many of the farmers affected by the Avian flu outbreak.  Will do all I can to help get things back to normal
@OccasionalBerk @unitedutilities you will find water in London undrinkable all year round!
@TomDavies_golf thank you for your idea of wateraid. raised it today UU showed strong interest
@unitedutilities @WaterAidUK am told compensation will be paid by UU to customers. Why not consider donating it to those without water?
Reassured by visit to United Utilities plant at centre of water problems in Lancashire. Staff working hard towards resolution.
The Labour leadership is turning into SPADs v Corbyn.
@TomDavies_golf will be meeting UU on site tomorrow. shall discuss your idea and also seek urgent resolution to  problems
Airport shops urged to pass VAT savings on to customers. The scheme is for customers benefit not profit margins!  http://t.co/2njzC6iVQr
@TomDavies_golf @unitedutilities @David_Cameron good idea. Shall contact UU to see what it's plans are?
@montie @nytdavidbrooks brooks forgets the last 2 US NIE's that clearly say Iran gave up ambitions years ago.

@bbcnickrobinson erhmmmm!
@OccasionalBerk I would be delighted to help you with the problems you are having; please email me at; wallaceb@parliament.uk with details
The disappointment on David Dimbley's face is remarkably similar as the same time 5 years ago when exit polls shredded Clegg effect! #GE2015
@Labour_BenW just read your negative letter sent out today. You couldn't resist it. Sad reflection on you Ben.
@OhNoItsSteve you are right. long day. I'll fight to continue investment in Wyre &amp; Preston, secure DWP on Fylde, support exports &amp; business
@Labour_BenW Ben i have spent 5 yrs visiting doctors and nurses in Preston and i promise you they are not amazed by Labour
@Labour_BenW @MBRoberts4004 @benjastley sorry Ben it is "doctor" not "doctors"
@Labour_BenW was Andy Burnham at RLI to apologise for Morecambe Bay tragedy or to use NHS as a political weapon?
@Labour_BenW @Fulwood_NorthLP Sorry Ben that's not your policy.
@Labour_BenW we did. Not proof read was it?
@Fulwood_NorthLP @Labour_BenW lets ask Dennis Skinner, Flint, Benn and Hoyle what they think of employing family?
@Fulwood_NorthLP yes where has @Labour_BenW old tweets gone? Could they have been deleted?
@ianmcgill1960 @Labour_BenW @Fulwood_NorthLP yes it was Labour who moved firefighters pension age or have you forgotten 2006?
@Labour_BenW read back of my leaflet 10 things for Wyre and Preston. Where's your manifesto? @benjastley
@Fulwood_NorthLP failed again. What are you going to do for Preston and Wyre?
@jameschappers real question for Labour is whether they will let an English education Bill pass using SNP votes?
@Fulwood_NorthLP oh dear. You really can't be positive &amp; say what you are going to do. Only nasty little sneers. What are your ideas?
@Fulwood_NorthLP Negative! Negative! Sad really. Labour having nothing to offer but insults. Lets here your ideas not attacks on others
@Springleanet i'm never confident and never take my constituents for granted.
@DewhurstTony Sussex has plenty pf Shale
@Fulwood_NorthLP @Labour_BenW that would be the plan that has delivered record growth, record employment, lower poverty a d lower inequality

@mattmoorek @SamuelCoates given how Trident is procured &amp; run it would be virtually impossible to split it out from MOD day to day funding.
@mattmoorek NHS, Schools, defence all possible but only based on solid budget &amp; finance bill. Oppositions regularly vote against them
@Fulwood_NorthLP @Labour_BenW was your candidate every part of the Scottish Socialist workers while at Edinburgh university?
@JeremyCliffe @FraserNelson but can you fatten a pig on market day?
@colinrtalbot @SamCoatesTimes can you give an example of when amended?
@colinrtalbot @BWallace4WPN @SamCoatesTimes most interesting then
@colinrtalbot @SamCoatesTimes the key is the relationship between a finance Bill ( which can be amended &amp; estimates that cannot
@jameschappers @SamCoatesTimes we support trident. We don't support fantasy SNP-Labour economics or their budgets.
@paulwaugh @tnewtondunn @SamCoatesTimes @ToryTreasury any vote for budget is vote for trident as maintenance, research &amp; basing is from mod
@SamCoatesTimes only capital expenditure for new subs could perhaps be carved out. So in supply motion SNP would be voting for trident
@SamCoatesTimes the problem for SNP is that maintenance, research and basing of current and new trident is out of MOD main expenditure 1/2
@Tims_r_us they were. We warned against splitting the regulation 3 ways.
@bethanseward @Labour_BenW @johnpotterLD @NorthLancsGreen @UKIPPreston I am not against regulated fracking with proper safeguards

"not just a light touch, but a limited touch." Gordon Brown on the city 2005. Just in case anyone might have forgotten this morning
Would Sturgeon &amp; SNP vote in a confidence &amp; supply arrangement for a budget which makes provision for Trident? @bbcnickrobinson

@StuartBroadbent also coalition doubled small business rate relief, and cut Labour's Ni employers rate!
@StuartBroadbent from2007 to 2008 Labour out UP small business corp tax from 19% to 21% . Coalition cut it from 2010 to 20%. not 200% rise
@OccasionalBerk my main concern at present is B4rn being undermined by LCC directed roll out when they are already in an area
@OccasionalBerk my last meeting before Parl dissolved was with LCC + BT to maintain pressure for roll out.
@OccasionalBerk  while not all rural areas been enabled a number have. It does take time to lay infrastructure, clear EU &amp; award contracts
@OccasionalBerk why do you blame BT. You KNOW where the public money is spent for hard to reach areas is directed by Lancs C C.
@OccasionalBerk on the contrary have helped dozens of constits with rural broadband but hard to help anonymous tweeters in unknown locations
@DanHannanMEP @iainmartin1 @Bromund @CapX only some one who has never traded with US would make the assertion it is already "free". it isn't
@MrChrisBeard good evening. Pensioner poverty lowest since records began.
oh dear Labour's non-dom policy unravelling. Details show they WON'T actual abolish non-dom status. just consult on how long you can be a ND
@MrChrisBeard inequality as in the gap the between rich and poor.
@MrChrisBeard and if they live in Tory run Wyre no council tax rise for 5 yrs. same can't be said under Labour run Preston or LCC.
@MrChrisBeard they've also seen falling fuel duty, low inflation and help to buy schemes.
@MrChrisBeard much better under the Coalition for them. They have had a tax cut, a job and a more disposable income than when you left!
@MrChrisBeard but poverty is down as is youth unemployment. so it is not us that has abandoned them.
@MrChrisBeard not under a Labour recession it wasn't.
@MrChrisBeard @Labour_BenW have you  forgotten Labour's regional spatial strategy where local's had no say &amp; Garstang was due 000's of homes
@MrChrisBeard you will also be please that because of our government the North West is the fastest growing part of UK.
@MrChrisBeard you'll also be please youth unemployment is massively down in Preston + Wyre. Labour abandoned young people on benefits.
@MrChrisBeard you'll of course be please that as a result poverty is down, inequality is down, pensioner poverty lowest since war. 1\2
@MrChrisBeard @rsnapeuk what a ridiculous thing to say. I will vote for measures to deliver a strong economy. worked so far.
@MrChrisBeard last month asked Secretary of State to call in application if it progresses to give time for plan to develop.
@MrChrisBeard I opposed the application last July and it was withdrawn. it has been resubmitted recently. Last month I asked 1/2
@rsnapeuk and for young people our "help to buy scheme" and property ISA's will help them buy their first home. 3\3
@rsnapeuk for us in Wyre continued support for manufacturing, thru apprenticeships, and research funding is important 2\3
@rsnapeuk first priority is to continue our economic recovery so we can fund services and infrastructure in Wyre properly. 1/2

Anti-Fracking Parliamentary Candidate Wanted to Work for Frackers http://t.co/fYyYXmHdIi via @guidofawkes; very disappointing
@ARFairclough sorry if you email me at; wallace4wpn@btopenworld.com we can discuss. Or I can call round.
@ARFairclough well I delivered the street personally over a year ago. It was a black &amp; white leaflet with Councillor/MP details on it.
@ARFairclough of 72000 constituents not everyone agrees what our area needs.  I am really happy to come to and meet you
@ARFairclough What does "no matter what " mean? I can only represent you if you communicate your needs. I can't guess.
@ARFairclough you would have had two leaflets over last 12 months with my details and councillors details on it.
@ARFairclough I have recently worked with the local County Councillor to fix your streets pot hole.
@Labour_BenW you might like to actually ask before making personnel attacks.
@Labour_BenW thanks for the tip! what are you PROMISING to actually do if you are elected.
@Labour_BenW have been in contact with 8 households on Southfield drive. Case work is not always for grandstanding. Action not words.
@Labour_BenW yes
@tnewtondunn according to IFS only 0.8% of workers are on zero hours. Same as in 2000. And 30% of that number are the wish of the worker.
@Labour_BenW @ARFairclough 2/2 and not so long ago met with UU and council officials to try and get dykes behind houses properly cleared
@Labour_BenW @ARFairclough e.g in Southfield Drive I have recently tried to help with parking problems on street ...1/2
@Labour_BenW @ARFairclough totally agree that's why I have made dozens &amp; dozens of visits to schools, hospitals, businesses &amp; constituents
@StuartBroadbent if all that isn't good enough for your vote then I am sure I can find more achievements.
@StuartBroadbent and trading up, exports up, inflation down and while doing it we protected NHS spending.
@StuartBroadbent and that we have lifted millions of the lowest paid out of tax and end restricted working of zero hours contracts
@StuartBroadbent and that under the coalition the rich actually pay more in tax and Labour's tax avoidance scandal has been reformed
@StuartBroadbent and pensions rise linked to incomes, and pension reforms to annuities, and the increase in family disposable income
@StuartBroadbent and GDP growth, and 50% cut in unemployment, and manufacturing growth and cutting deficit, and £430 m city deal for Preston
@StuartBroadbent of course you welcome that under conservatives poverty is down, inequality is down, pensioner poverty lowest on record
@DPJHodges IFS figures show only 0.8% of workers are on zero hours. Same figure as 2000. add to that 30% of those on them want them.
IFS figures show 0.8% of jobs zero hour contracts - same as in 2000 + fact 85% of new jobs since 2010 are full time. Labour's red herring!

@Tims_r_us which ever spin doctor gets to them first!
key question for Labour+SNP is not confidence + Supply but would Labour use SNP votes for English only policy like Education, NHS etc?
during all this Richard 3rd was really a "nice man" puff we shouldn't forget there are 2 sides to the story just like there were 2 princes..
Can't understand why Labour would hide massive donations from a Hedge fund manager?....

@CharlieWoof81 compared to when Labour left office in 2010 inequality is down, child poverty is down, youth unemployment is down.
Gender pay gap narrowed. Pensioner poverty lowest EVER
share of income tax paid by highest 1% higher than at anytime under Labour.
compared to when Labour left office in 2010 inequality is down, child poverty is down, youth unemployment is down.

Employment growing fastest in North West than anywhere else in UK. 80% of jobs full time.  North growing faster than South

@MBRoberts4004 Gov need to work towards "gold standard"  that deals with impact of fracking traffic, noise, waste water. All possible
@CharlieWoof81 @gmcneill57  behind your Labour scare stories on the NHS lies good old hate. No sensible debate, no solutions, so no victory
https://t.co/sv4Axb2aQF
@jon_swindon enjoy the SNP.. They are going to eat Labour for Breakfast.
@CharlieWoof81 88% of all medical consultations are with GP's who are private contractors!!!! will Labour Nationalise them? doubt....
@CharlieWoof81 the point is, which you obviously missed, if you are going to attack Tories for NHS you should also Labour on same grounds
@CharlieWoof81 slight problem under Labour total NHS PFI deals was way above £780m. so it looks like Labour broke record

Jim Murphy stupidly thinks if he can bash the Tories the loudest then he'll save Scottish Labour. The Scots aren't that stupid Jim.
Labour wonder why the SNP keep beating them. It's because they abandoned blue collar aspiration &amp; the SNP offered hope not hand outs.
if Scottish Labour allow the SNP to become relevant to the General Election then they will be signing their own death warrant
@JBeattieMirror they paid price for their cheap politics of  80's + 90's that labelled UK Gov illegitimate over Scotland. can't out nat Nats
@JBeattieMirror it was such a successful lead role that at least 3 out 10 of their own voters deserted them.

@_Matt3r @duggandm wrong again.
@_Matt3r @duggandm in future before you make such chippy, ignorant comments do your home work.
@_Matt3r @duggandm you describe yourself as a Bennite. would that be the public school educate Tony Benn and 2nd Viscount &amp; officer?
@duggandm @_Matt3r son of a teacher, father grew up an orphan in a mining village, grandfather a dentist. crime to better oneself? #chippy
@FletchPete @PoppyLegion it needs sorting. Both are deserved benefits for our forces so we shouldn't discriminate
@ianroberts1965 you def had the late shift! Great to be home!
@peterdoodes I have decided that before your mad and unfounded conspiracies accuse me of killing JFK that it is best to block you.
@peterdoodes not for the first time you engage twitter before your brain.
@peterdoodes @Aunty_Fracker @danielbyles @FrackingRegs @Refracktion have you ever been to Iran?
@peterdoodes @Aunty_Fracker @danielbyles @FrackingRegs @Refracktion didn't think working for QinetiQ made me one but so be it
@_Matt3r @duggandm @ClaireyBeeS FYI North Sea Oil is in direct competition with fracking so no conflict.
@_Matt3r @duggandm silly me. I should have been a party researcher and gone straight into politics rather than work in real world.
@WoodplumptonGM and they would be the same 1% who pay over 30% of all income tax?
@WoodplumptonGM I still find it pertinent but it is odd how the media are re-heating old stories.
@WoodplumptonGM why is a leak that happened 8 years ago a "new" story?
@ClaireyBeeS so will you meet?
@ClaireyBeeS you say you represent hundreds of people at Westby. are you elected? would be good to know who you are? why don't you email me?
@ClaireyBeeS @Aunty_Fracker @Refracktion @MBRoberts3691 amazing  thing about all this is I opposed Cuadrilla's applic on grounds of impact
@WoodplumptonGM happy to try. But of course he isn't in office or trying to run the country like Balls is. Labour did nothing on tax avoid
@ClaireyBeeS @Aunty_Fracker @Refracktion @MBRoberts3691 I don't have a "support group". I am a local MP who listens to both sides.
@peterdoodes please do your research. look at public register of interest and you will see I stopped in Feb 14. it's all out in public
@peterdoodes so do you support King's view on international Climate change treatises? or are you going to select which of his views to push
@WoodplumptonGM I know. I shall ask Ed Balls this week why as City Minister he did nothing to stop such abuse.
@ClaireyBeeS @Aunty_Fracker @Refracktion @MBRoberts3691 amazing how all these Green groups were completely silent.
@ClaireyBeeS @Aunty_Fracker @Refracktion @MBRoberts3691 for last 12 yrs I have opposed Gas storage in Wyre estuary b/c geology wasn't sound.
@ClaireyBeeS @Aunty_Fracker @Refracktion because you contacted me. So one last time will you meet with me to discuss your concerns?
@ClaireyBeeS @BWallaceMP @peterdoodes @Aunty_Fracker @Refracktion yes. will be happy to discuss all the reports with you when we meet
@peterdoodes @Aunty_Fracker @ClaireyBeeS @Refracktion for  last 12 years i've opposed Gas storage firm Canatax because geology wasn't sound
@Aunty_Fracker @ClaireyBeeS @Refracktion Lady Claire the invite is to you as you individually contact me on twitter and make the remarks.
@Aunty_Fracker @ClaireyBeeS @Refracktion now back to the issue Lady Claire will you meet with me? this is the 3d time of asking.
@peterdoodes @IanChisnall @ebonyavajohnson @RAFF_group @Refracktion and answer is no. haven't been for year
@peterdoodes @IanChisnall @ebonyavajohnson @RAFF_group @Refracktion when I last looked Bently oil field is offshore +1000 miles away
@ClaireyBeeS answer is no. and when I last looked the north sea field Bentley was off shore and over 1000 miles from Fylde.
@peterdoodes @IanChisnall oh dear you are out of date on Iran and iran policies.
@peterdoodes @RhubarbGrumble yes a good study which is why we will follow part 7 of it! UK has advantage of mature gas distribution network
@ClaireyBeeS @Aunty_Fracker @Refracktion Lady Claire will you accept my invite to meet face to face at my surgery? Or a time that suits
@ClaireyBeeS i've asked if you will come to one of my surgeries to discus the issues. Happy to meet in my constituency
@Rob_Parr great eccleston; fulwood and Garstang.
@ClaireyBeeS I was today. out in Inskip. so will you come to surgery in Great Eccleston?
@ClaireyBeeS instead of giving out patronising and rude tweets why don't you come to my next surgery and we can discuss fracking?
@RhubarbGrumble also commitment to new nuclear, off shore wind and gas rather than coal is all part of reducing emissions.
@RhubarbGrumble Thank you for  answer. I recognise urgency but we won't agree on timescale. Gov is trying to tackle waste thru green deal
excellent visit to Kepple lane pharmacy in Garstang. A great team delivering a 1st class service to Wyre patients. @KeppleLane
@RhubarbGrumble UK committee on Climate change say Shale preferable over Coal and LNG. which part of that do you not understand?
@RhubarbGrumble yes agree so what timescale do you recommend? a.)immediately b.) 5 yrs c.) 10yrs d.) 30yrs. what would you use in meantime?
@JohnCains1 @BWallaceMP @iainmartin1 @ChrisMasonBBC you prove my point. Was it the Unions fault or the Government of the day?
@ChrisMasonBBC @iainmartin1 It's no good Brown trying to blame us. They tried to out Nat the Nats instead of defending the Union.
@ChrisMasonBBC @iainmartin1 for 30 years Scottish Labour linked the Tories &amp; Westminster and bashed them both. Labour broke the Union #panic
@scottishlabour @DPJHodges linking the Tories and Westminster and bashing both for decades is why scottish Labour killed the Union
@scottishlabour @DPJHodges the only way scottish Labour survives is to rule out any form of pact with SNP. will you do it?
@MBRoberts4004 yes excellent. kept saying to Mrs W "i've tweeted him"! I had a very interesting response to my email replies on fracking.
SNP fabricated reasons for fracking ban, says expert | via @Telegraph http://t.co/ECH2SPKrE2
@ClaireyBeeS so telling me I like the sound of my own voice and calling me "deary" in that patronising way is good manners?
@ClaireyBeeS which part of "I support the County's recommendations with regards to traffic and noise" do you not grasp on recent application
@ClaireyBeeS on fracking?
@ClaireyBeeS it is representing my constituents or do you wish to see Lancs services cut to fund scottish bribes.
http://t.co/P3VObruTAd
has Labour lost it's mind when being a Unionist party? panic makes people do ridiculous things.
@IanChisnall where's the dogma in any of this? and fracking was invented in 19 C with first commercial frack tried in 40's
@pneGianni I shall find out if any.
@IanChisnall amazing how Greens want us to believe scientists on climate change but want us to ignore them on Fracking! #hypocracy
@DewhurstTony @MBRoberts4004 .it's a bit desperate quoting "Russia today".  Who could possible have a vested interest against UK Gas??
@MBRoberts4004 @bareftdoctor however had an excellent meeting with Treasury officials to start sketching out shape of a Lancs shale fund
@MBRoberts4004 @bareftdoctor i'm not fine with such north-south things.
@bareftdoctor Labour's clause will mean you can't frack in South but can in the North....!!!
@tnewtondunn  Mr Burnham made everything clear on Newsnight. Use soundbites to keep Unions sweet &amp; hopefully they won't notice the policy
when you collect together a number of standalone soundbites and try force them into a policy you end up with Labour's incoherent NHS Plan
@jimmurphymp er but UK Labour wouldn't.
Burnham says Welsh NHS is different because service clustered along south coast. So look out Morecambe Bay NHS services.
Burnham &amp; Labour on their failure to run NHS Wales "nothing to see here move along". Woeful. Has he forgotten his Party's record on Stafford
Greens failed to vote against Infrastructure Bill and Labour join with Conservatives to block moratorium on fracking. well well....
@WoodplumptonGM not correct
@WoodplumptonGM or it won't matter if I vote for it
@WoodplumptonGM it may surprise you but oil and gas beneath our feet hasn't belonged to us for over 40 yrs.
@WoodplumptonGM I haven't been pressured by the Chancellor. I have spent a year studying the science. That will guide me.
@jimmurphymp Jim, try being a Unionist. This type of stuff on Mansion tax is cheap.
on Monday we will witness Labour using SNP MP's to block policy in England. Perhaps the shape of things to come in May..
SNP have NO right to dictate energy policy or planning south of the border. vote Labour get SNP. Truly horrifying prospect for England
@pneGianni John only 3 constituents contacted me about saving the bus station and one was you!
@pneGianni yes. Like the bus station John the number of constituents who have contacted me against fracking is not even 25! Out of 72000..
@Refracktion @MBRoberts4004 @CuadrillaUK I'll rely on Royal Society, Royal Academy of Engineering, British Geological Survey for the facts
@pneGianni in words of Obama "Science doesn't go away just because you vote against it." LCC happy with safety and science.
@Refracktion @MBRoberts4004 Lancs are satisfied with safety, science + enviro impact of fracking. Roads + noise need solving. Not impossible
@MBRoberts4004 in the words of Obama "Science doesn't go away just because you vote against it."
@Fracking_Facts I agree. Science doesn't go away just because some people wish to vote against.
Excellent tour of PNE with Peter Ridsdale. A club to be proud of. @pnefc
@MBRoberts4004 I have forwarded your blog to all my colleagues! sorry about that..
Darien Scheme, Clearances, corrupt act of union vote, poll tax..now vow! All part of keeping the myth of oppression alive.
SNP need the conspiracy to continue to keep their mission alive. "we were tricked." Such nonsense. Nats should actually read the vow
@raefil their bonuses must have come from the £11bn PFI NHS deals done under Labour that will eventually cost £63bn!
http://t.co/0yfEQWkYb5
@MBRoberts4004 have read the blog. will no one listen to science anymore!!!!
@Tims_r_us not all is as seems in article. main block is now Iranian's wanting to search our diplomatic bags! am meeting them next week.
Labour's phoney amendments on fracking depth would stop fracking in South but mean open season in the North. @TheGreenParty
@ButterworthLyn I'm happy with the volumes of scientific reports I have read that fracking can be done safely
@MBRoberts4004 it is one thing to raise legitimate questions about the geology,disturbance and risks of fracking but really....
@pneGianni perhaps you should ask Labour. They support fracking and you are a member of that party.
The SNP will have more MP's, and more councillors before and after GE. They should be part of any TV debate.
@Refracktion getting personnel...another sign of being weak on the arguments
@Refracktion your constant moving of the arguments shows how weak your knowledge is
@Refracktion you can't keep changing the premises of the argument. you say MP's shouldn't support non UK companies. I say your wrong
@Refracktion doesn't stop you using Twitter who's profits aren't in UK
@Refracktion i've done plenty and continue to do so.
@Refracktion on your logic MP's shouldn't promote Land Rover or Nissan or Airbus! bonkers!
@Refracktion I didn't I said the gas was from the UK. I'll promote UK companies, such as BAE but also any company that supports jobs
@Aunty_Fracker good luck with selling Qatar as a human rights record comparable with EU poppet!
@Refracktion it's the tax revenues i'm interested in. or do you believe only UK companies should trade in UK?
@adculley1 Both Labour, Conservatives and Lib Dem support TTIP. Negotiations aren't nearly finished. when complete  EU Parliament with vote
@Refracktion the gas is sourced in UK. you will also know if you had done home work how gas / oil tax is field based not coy based
@Aunty_Fracker @Refracktion but most of our gas and Europe's comes from mid east, UK and Russia
@MBRoberts4004 @Aunty_Fracker @Refracktion  If we are going to buy gas should we not buy from UK rather than dodgy human rights abusers?
@StuartBroadbent We are not, as the State seeking to store Comms data.  We want to ensure ISPs hold the data should we need it on request
Comms data is an aid to investigation. Just like fingerprints.  Clegg shouldn't make it more than it is.
@tnewtondunn failure to rule out SNP pact will be terminal for Scottish Labour. Makes SNP relevant in Westminster elections for 1st time
http://t.co/a0jsWAfULF
@SadButMadLad @MBRoberts4004 people should see the so called "letter from Lord Browne" put out by Greenpeace! scandalous and misleading
@Labour_BenW so do most of the Labour MP's of Lancashire
@Labour_BenW slight weakness in your plan...Labour support Fracking
@crumblebum_bg @scottishlabour @jimmurphymp @DPJHodges not to me but the principle of UK citizens being equal is
@crumblebum_bg @scottishlabour @jimmurphymp @DPJHodges not point. issue is why can't English voters receive a fair share of revenue the tax
so according to Ed Miliband today NHS England needs more money. So much so that he is sending it to the Scottish NHS first? #nocredibility
@JBeattieMirror no but to play Scotland off against the south is childish bollocks that breaks the spirit of the Union.
@scottishlabour @jimmurphymp @DPJHodges My Lancashire constituents will be delighted to learn they come second to Scotland under Labour
@scottishlabour @jimmurphymp @DPJHodges playing south off against Scotland is a stupid game that undermines the Union you fought to save
@jameschappers what utter tosh! from Labour. Panic scaremongering is not a substitute for policy
http://t.co/ADjyZmR4tF;
@raefil and to you. Let's hope that it is PNE's year in 2015
The SNP might like to forget but many of us won't. http://t.co/FlcNoPInw3
@JZarif May I wish you a happy Christmas and let us hope we move forward to resolve the outstanding issues in 2015. peace be upon you
@Jeremy_DEagle no. And we have too many "professional politicians"
Ed Miliband introduces his new policies - all comedy repeats! http://t.co/qZri1FIMer
@StuartBroadbent I thought you liked independent backbenchers?
If the Labour Party truly wants to be the only alternative UK Government to Tories they need to rule out an SNP coalition at Westminster.
why did Today programme choose Devon rather than the only part of UK to have had a regional referendum to discuss EVEL? @BBCr4today
We already have "2 tiers" of MPs. A Lancashire MP can't vote on Scottish matters but a Scottish MP can vote on Lancashire laws. #unfair
@StuartBroadbent no it wasn't. Gov supported Bill's aims.
@mooey292 I am afraid I will be voting to enact changes to Firefighters pensions. We have put in safeguards to protect mis-use by employers
@Tims_r_us they already have. in Practice they don't always stick to that self imposed rule. If in coalition they would have to
If Labour do a deal with SNP at next GE it will be the ultimate insult to English voters. SNP MP's dictating English policy.
@jimmurphymp @LucyMPowell Congratulations Jim. We'll deserved. Good luck.
@hosul07 Goodbye Harriet. We have all enjoyed you working in our office. Have a wonderful Xmas and hurry back!
Unelected Labour Peers boasting about defeating elected MP's. Keir Hardie would weep! http://t.co/VKjaAkjGJ9
unelected Lords over turning elected House of Commons Judicial review reforms. We sent them majorities of 100+. Bizarre Labour are boasting
@nickth86 of course we are all against poverty but to try imply Tories caused those things ignores the facts.
@nickth86 Food banks, privatisation of NHS, TTIP all started under Labour. Well done.
@nickth86 80% of new jobs full time not part time.
@nickth86 Labour cared so much for poor they did nothing to reform zero hours contracts or tackle overseas tax avoidance by tech giants
@raefil I know in 13 years Labour did nothing to tackle Zero hours contracts or overseas tax avoiding tech giants. Took coalition to do that
@IIO_Pennine Unemployment down, inflation down, growth up, deficit down. If that's a big game then I'm not ashamed.
@raefil by ensuring poorest have jobs to go to is better than Labour's plans for mass unemployment. Labour's deficit betrayed the poor

after a year of lobbying and rows the North West gets a Sovereign wealth fund for revenues from Shale! Victory.
Will Miliband rule out giving the SNP another referendum as a price for coalition? especially if SNP get only a few more MP's.
@MiketodmanM yes have pressed released it. Given I campaigned for last 10 yrs. actions more important than words
@chrisdeerin I weep for Scotland.
@AndrewSNicoll they want their cake &amp; eat it. Protection of UK law for business they claim they carry out overseas. need new thinking on tax
If Google, facebook, want protection of law from Gov snooping then they need to move servers here. they won't because it means paying tax.
Overseas internet comp including Google act as judge &amp; jury on what UK law enforcement is "allowed" to see while all the time avoiding tax

Just like Brown had to go to Rochdale to apologise to Mrs Duffy for sneering so Ed Milband should go to Rochester to say sorry to Dan.
@EmilyThornberry @LouiseMensch Emily you abandoned your excellent candidate to UKIP. If Labour wants to be future Gov it needs Rochester.

@OccasionalBerk also do you know if the BT  cabinets could technically allow other providers to link fibre to property?
@OccasionalBerk can I take it most are happy with the tech to the Cabinet? The issue is not enough cabinets and copper wire etc to dwelling?
@OccasionalBerk but I never said you didn't. Even the report you linked to on savings connection was £2050 per dwelling.
@OccasionalBerk no they don't check the rules. B4RN qualifies.
@OccasionalBerk @wispame @Yorkie71 The question should be put to Lancs CC which postcodes are you spending the BDUK money in? They won't say
@OccasionalBerk but those groups do get support thru Enterprise Investment Schemes - 30% tax relief.
@OccasionalBerk they wanted more money than the taxpayer could afford. It was that simple.
@OccasionalBerk  if you read his comments in full you will note he says very little. I worked with his coy bidding for gov def in past.
@OccasionalBerk @wispame @Yorkie71 and as a former employee of QinetiQ working in coms and sensors I know more than most about future tech
@OccasionalBerk @wispame @Yorkie71 for the record I am not a supporter of BT anymore than any other tel company.
@OccasionalBerk @wispame @Yorkie71 I have read the report and agree duct sharing could reduce costs but even then the figures are huge
@OccasionalBerk @superfastlancs I am not against FTTP I wish we could all have it but the tax payer doesn't have the billions it would cost
@OccasionalBerk taking CAP away from farmers and spending it 10 times over isn't supportive of the countryside

The key to a northern power house will be a sovereign wealth fund from Shale Gas revenues. Without it we will not be able to deliver change
@Namurian1 Revenues incentivesed States to improve regulatory regime and invest in monitoring and planning expertise. incentives matter
@Namurian1 @LancashireCC do you ever wonder why US shale developed so rapidly? perhaps it's the 9 - 13% of revenues that go to community.
I sometimes wonder if the EU actually has any idea about reality.
UKIP's alliance with far Right Polish Congress of New Right shows they are the BNP in blazers.
@NorthWesterly given Wyre + Preston North has one of the highest home ownership without mortgage I suspect it might also benefit us

@Tims_r_us It was the SNP who used the ridiculous slogan about Tories forever. Even tonight they claim only they speak for Scotland.
@Tims_r_us I was an MSP for 4 years. NAT is simple shorthand they call themselves Scot Nats. I don't assume you are a Nat.
@Tims_r_us coming from a Nat the word "lie" sounds hollow. Scotland isn't a thing owned by SNP that should be love bombed or anything else.
@pneGianni I am afraid John, your Party doesn't want anything English. Just a fudge for Big Cities.
@pneGianni English votes for English laws. City regions would be bad for those outside them &amp; NE comprehensively rejected Regional Assembly
Glad to see that the Scottish people rejected "ending Tory rule forever"
@corvusprodo but not the Pre-vote view that the result would stand for "a generation or even a lifetime".
@PeteWishart @paulwaugh Peter you lost. Time to accept that separation is over for this generation and lifetime.
Dear SNP + Yes leadership - you lost. LOST. LOST. Accept it. No more divisive referendums, not for a generation or this lifetime.
if the result is NO I can hear Salmond's verdict now "Bluff and Bluster" "stuff and nonsense"
@StuartBroadbent I was in Scottish Parliament from 99. Devo max is not substitute for making the positive case for Britain.
@StuartBroadbent devolution didn't kill of the Nats, then when SNP won in 2007 we gave more devo, result: SNP swept the board.
@SJacksonMP "They were the disposed reclaiming what was theirs" was a lyric from his songs I remember!
i'm British Mr Salmond and there is nothing you can do or say to change that. Not now and not next week
@StuartBroadbent  yes maybe but the irony is it was Gordon Brown that said devolution would kill off the Nats in 97!

@BKWhittingham I didn't say I did.
@raefil @BKWhittingham oh yes, either of you actually "served" so to speak?
@raefil @BKWhittingham the point is I wouldn't believe everything you read in a hypocritical tabloid.
Beginning to wonder if Burnham + Miliband understand NHS at all.
In 1948 GP's opted out of joining NHS preferring to remain private contractors. Vast parts of NHS have always been delivered by private sect
@BKWhittingham @raefil from the Daily mirror who paid it's editor £1.6m in 2010." Do as I say not as I do". True socialists
@BKWhittingham @raefil it is tripe to say one class works and another doesn't. Most people work hard no matter where they come from.
@LucyMPowell @BBCr4today but under Labour 4% of NHS spending was in private sector. Compared to 1.3% growth under coalition.
Under Labour  4% of NHS budget was spent in the private sector. Let's not forget that during Burnhams complaint about 1.3% under coalition
@BKWhittingham never heard of it. But then I'm not class obsessed. I'll leave that tripe to Labour.

@TheTributeAct  don't need a history lesson. Union was passed by Scottish Parliament. It wasn't blackmail. Made economic sense then as now
How did Polish made MANPAD's captured in Georgia by Russian Army find their way into Ukrainian separatists?
Iran helped US to topple Taliban in 2001 so won't be the first time if they find themselves on same side in Iraq
@iainmacwhirter @chrisdeerin the Myth that the Union was "done" to Scotland and needs to be cast aside is one of the great untruths of  ref
The leading Shia Cleric Sustani is a mainstream, reforming cleric. His call to arms demonstrates the extent to which Iraq must be on brink
@raefil yup
Iraq on the brink...pity the civilians. A disaster with wide implications for the West and Iran. Blair should be ashamed.
There is a big difference between pardons for on the runs and those issued for informers in NI.
@raefil couldn't have out it better
Sweden, Netherlands, Czech, and Italy would do it

Instead of the Fox being in the Westminster hen house he seems to be in Malta!
It is my guess that if Tory MEP's join with German ADF we will get Junckers. If not we have a chance of Lagarde or perhaps Letta of Italy
While UKIP volunteers are in Newark it seems Nigel Farage is in Monaco! ...
Juncker + Shulz are a wrong choice for Europe because they are the old generation. As a pro-eu MP we need a modern, reforming President.
@UKlPVoter @petercoles44 yup UKIP couldn't have been funded without EU money + allowances for their MEP's.
@LucyMPowell it's all about fire and manoeuvre Lucy!
We should remember that Iran's President does not control the judiciary. Others do.
President Rouhani's "enemy within" are trying to undermine his international efforts by oppression of human rights at home.
Nice to see unelected Lord Oakeshott trying to oust and co-ord elected Nick Clegg. Lib Dems so consistent with their principles
@bigvaldrewski 19000 BAE jobs in Lancashire depend partly on access to EU markets and collaboration. Why risk it by leaving EU?
@OldBearsCrow @jontycampbell  no but it helps. I've been in the negotiations. Try getting one for UK-Brazil?
@OldBearsCrow @jontycampbell your 21st C maybe. I am part of EU-US trade deal. Protection is live + well accross world
@jontycampbell @OldBearsCrow  that is what happens without trading blocks. Import tarrifs. Try exporting to NZ or US
@mclaughlan57 @Stewart_Whyte no wonder electorate get turned off when UKIP just make things up.
@mclaughlan57 @Stewart_Whyte Romania doesn't even have a population of 28m!
@OldBearsCrow because funnily enough you can't have free movement of goods in exchange for nothing.
@mclaughlan57 @Stewart_Whyte it is exactly what UKIP spout on a routine basis. Don't forget the scare that 28 m. Romanians were on the way.
UKIP vote represents 9.39% of electorate. I know press love a good panic but is it really a revolution? Only time will tell.
UKIP always scare about 400 million plus coming to UK from EU. Never say UK business has access to 400 million customers across continent
BNP vote droped 6.2%. I wonder where the votes could have gone?
Based on 35% turnout there is no "clear mandate" to leave EU.
Before everyone gets too excited tonight let's not forget turnout was only about 35%.
The story that will not be written tonight will be the collapse of the BNP in the North West.
Didn't Lib Dem Gidley loose her seat at last election? Lib Dem leaflets would classify her as "failed MP"?
@chrisdeerin all 20k readers will be able to figure it out.
@paulwaugh. Not in Carlisle, Bolton or even Wigan!
@Namurian1  that's why my proposal is only at the development phase not the exploration phase.
@Namurian1 that's on top of federal tax. My point is UK treasury should take a little less and County get little more. Not touch total take
@Namurian1  yup that's in North Dakota where Shale Gas coys pay State 9% of revenues. Funny they can invest and pay!

Science is all about international collaboration. Our Patent box tax regime is about locking IP exploitation into the UK.
So we spent years establishing a competitive tax regime and Patent Box policy to attract foreign coy and when they come we don't want them?
@StuartBroadbent GNER lost franc not because of its running but parent coy losses elsewhere. Not opposed to stricter penalties.
@StuartBroadbent Eastcoast a good service but it is no where near as good as GNER when they ran it. Difference obvious.
@StuartBroadbent  sorry but been on Arriva Wales recently and it shows all the old traits of BR.
@StuartBroadbent  but we know nationalised companies are rarely as productive as private so profit is swallowed up by inefficiency. BR mk2
@mooey292 sorry but it wasn't a secret. No "leaked letter" it was on DCLG web on 30 April accomp by Tweet. Lewis wrote Matt Wreck 25 Feb.
@StuartBroadbent  but now taxpayers rather than private investors pay to lease trains from ROSCO's. Taxpayer pays twice - tickets and leases
@StuartBroadbent  if you think raising finance from private sector is hard you should try raising it from Treasury in recession.
@StuartBroadbent  the ROSCO's (rolling stock companies) have invested well over £7bn in sets.
@Spectator_CH @HamishMacdonell with their mighty readership of 24k not sure that will trigger a landslide.
@StuartBroadbent  no your right they have invested Share holders money.
If rail + energy companies can't raise funds for investment from markets then they will have to get it from the taxpayers. #failedsocialism

@BKWhittingham that's was a Free vote. Not a Party policy. Labour's policy is to support Fracking.

@BKWhittingham will you resign from the Labour Party if they continue to support fracking?

@davidwford if it is the Gov will give 30% income tax relief to your investors?
@davidwford is B4RN one of these? it a charity, a community interest company or a community benefit society or a social impact bond?
@morrishs2 sorry that's the link of study into cost of Broadband options done in 2008. Not HS2.
@morrishs2 @GarstangHour @PaulBigland1 this links to study; http://t.co/D85FN9JZcy
@GarstangHour @OccasionalBerk perfectly possible to support the large scale roll out of Broadband fttc as well as community projects
@OccasionalBerk @GarstangHour yes but you would be wrong and a wally because I never said Broadband would be unnecessary.
@OccasionalBerk overt support" will you listen to you?As if supporting a company is both a crime &amp; exclusive of being able to support others
£90m of tax relief on social investment over next 5 years in Budget 2014
Odd how public interest lawyers can't disclose how much it received in fees at same time it slams MOD disclosures? #BBCr4today
You can call yourself "public interest lawyers" all you like but it doesn't hide the fact their type are ambulance chasers
@iainmartin1 congratulations on your win tonight. Well deserved.
@GarstangHour @StubCrouch it is at the end of the day about money and uptake of service. Neither of which we have a lot of at moment
@StubCrouch no there wasn't and I am sure you will know I actually live in North Lancs unlike most
@GarstangHour no the problem is that we don't have the money to tailor broadband around the very few. I wish we could but we can't.
I wonder what Mr Snowden thinks about Ukraine??
@raefil as to the figure you quote I shall ask the HofC Library to investigate...
@raefil that would be by ATOS health care then? First contracted by.....Labour!!! Well done!
@raefil unlike the Iraqi orphans then...
@raefil or those millions abandoned  on incapacity benefits for years by uncaring Labour?
@raefil how about the graph of deaths from Labour's lraq war? Or Labours budget deficit growth?
@raefil doesn't hurt because I have read the founder of the trusts reasons behind food banks and their growth.
@raefil suggest you read the founder of the Trussell food banks views on cause before you so freely splat such graphs around.
@bigvaldrewski I don't judge you on who or where you are from. I judge your actions and policies.
I don't care what school anyone went to. What counts is ability! #boring
Conservative European Mainstream - we are out and we are proud.
Labour's Vicky Pollard EU policy avoids the case for Europe and seeks to treat public like fools. A sure way to push UK towards exit!
@StubCrouch such nonsense. If you look at future technological developments it will be uneccessary. You also just ignore price tag!
@GarstangHour a great aspiration but I am afraid at £28bn cost just not affordable. Also we really don't need 1GB\sec
What ever your position is on EU Ed Miliband should have the courage of his convictions &amp; put the case to the British people #referendum
What a coincidence on the day EU meets Iran president a plethora of Iran conspiracy theories...I wonder who might be puffing these stories?
@davidwford @GarstangHour @cyberdoyle I would love us to all get 1Gb broadband but according to2008 estimate It would cost £28.8bn for FTTP
@davidwford I live almost next door in Hornby and my area is NOT enabled according to BT. Caton is or is about to be.
@cyberdoyle yes but where does it join the internet?
@davidwford I am not sure that is the correct position of BT. The roll out will get to most of the Lune Valley, and rural areas.
@cyberdoyle @davidwford @GarstangHour @superfastlancs #B4RN Can you help clarify does B4RN use the Lancaster University Broadband supply?
@cyberdoyle @davidwford @GarstangHour @superfastlancs #B4RN it just isn't for the capital spend for FTTP.
@cyberdoyle @davidwford @GarstangHour @superfastlancs tell me what proportion of users actually will need over 80mb in next 10 yrs?
@cyberdoyle @davidwford @GarstangHour @superfastlancs #b4rn as I am sure you know part of the problem is demand as much as supply
@davidwford I think you realistically need to give BT more time. We will then see the real notspots.
@davidwford @cyberdoyle @GarstangHour @superfastlancs as a former director of QinetiQ and former COBOL programmer I beg to disagree
Attending the Geological society Shale UK conference to hear from the scientists. Good to hear facts not fiction #shaleuk
The behaviour of the Russian Bear is why the EU-US free trade treaty must be completed. Access to markets and acceptable standards.
@davidwford the simple fact is the taxpayer simply can't afford the £bn's required to FTTP the county. No one is in mood for tax hikes

@Namurian1 UK is the ONLY country in world who are not intending to properly share mineral revenues with locality. Even US share 7-13%
@Namurian1 it is mine and all our gas. Are you saying we shouldn't derive tax revenues from Gas? And if we do should we not share it?
@Namurian1 that's why key UK Gov starts conceding more £ tax revenue to the communities who make decisions.

@AlbertoGranado @afneil the rate you lot are going the Red Cross will be the only international organisation Scotland will be able to join
@afneil how many years has the SNP had time to prepare for this issue? It is pathetic and amateurish.
What price would Spain demand from Scotland for entry to EU? Fisheries for sure.
@StuartBroadbent thanks to this Gov foreign buyers pay stamp duty. Mansion tax might make money in London but will punish success elsewhere.
Why should unionist have "mutual respect" for Nats when they have "total disrespect" for the UK?
Salmond "Osborne doesn't speak for Scotland" err..yes he does as the British Chancellor &amp; 1.9m Scots that voted unionist in 2010 would agree
Scotland is a great nation. It doesn't need to leave the Union or the pound to maximise its potential.
Time to realise that the SNP and the consequences of separation are real on both sides of the border. It's not a game anymore#bettertogether
@StuartBroadbent you win. Voted to ban smoking in cars. You're fault!
@StuartBroadbent I was wrong on smoking in bar etc. So I guess your right on this one.
@StuartBroadbent not sure yet. Difficult one. If you accept the principle what's not to stop legislating in your own home? Not made mind up
@StuartBroadbent thank you.
@RacerReady merde!
Let's not forget Alan Baxter actually won a bronze in slalom for UK but was controversy stripped of it later #bbcsochi

So women only count in the "feminist sense" if they do things you agree with? For real?
@ChrisBryantMP @OliverCooper @LucyMPowell but for the record I am one I actually do support the use of all women short lists
@ChrisBryantMP @OliverCooper @LucyMPowell Lucy  giving some one leadership is not the same as giving some one a supporting role.
@OliverCooper @ChrisBryantMP @LucyMPowell how's the fight for more female leaders going in your Union paymasters? Unite - RMT - PCS - Unison
@OliverCooper @ChrisBryantMP @LucyMPowell in Labour women are good enough to adorn their male counterparts but not good enough to lead them?
@LucyMPowell so they are good enough for supporting roles only then?
@LucyMPowell how's the hunt for a Labour women prime minister going Lucy?
Looks like Nick Clegg can't even fight his way out of a plastic bag.

While the Westminster bubble is wetting its knickers over the non story the rest of us are worrying about economy, fracking, syria, NHS etc

So Labour, who politicised every quango in the land, is upset a Labour peer who was a mate of Tony Blair does not have her contract renewed?

@StuartBroadbent so why do Labour councils?
@StuartBroadbent Corby have 151 staff, Merton have 14% and Brent 18%. Of the top four, 3 are Labour + 1 lib dem
@StuartBroadbent according to bbc foi reports &amp; IBT foi's Doncaster has 2759 staff on zero hours
@StuartBroadbent by that do you mean all those Labour councils? They are one of the biggest culprits.
@StuartBroadbent 40% of 150K is already a lot more than 40% of 40k or 20% of 25K. So called "rich" already pay 30% of ALL income tax.
On Labour's watch they failed to regulate banks properly which resulted in panic mergers -RBS,HBOS. Now they complain not enough competition
@BBCNormanS yes but wasn't there a diamond jubilee and a Royal wedding in all that?
@StuartBroadbent the "rich" pay 30% of all income tax.  Paying of Labour's deficit will take more than Ball's gimmick
@StuartBroadbent didn't in practices tho did it?
@iainmartin1 @Kevin_Maguire in absence of a credible economic policy try the old diversion tactic. 50p that'll teach them.
@StuartBroadbent so given so few pay it and it is so little why do it? Gimmick
@StuartBroadbent top 1% of earners pay 30% of all income tax. At 200k an earner, after NI will pay nearly 100k in tax.
I'm worried Balls might have gone too far and people will discover he is a double agent for the Tory Party....

@BBCPropaganda @anthea_bailey I agree. If all feel they have a stake in the gas beneath their feet then it will happen
@BBCPropaganda no! They are also going to take 62% tax. They should take less and give Lancashire a little more.
Lancashire MP's &amp; County Council's issue letter to PM for more revenues from Fracking.
Treasury should take a little less and Lancashire a little more! #ShaleGas
In small print gov announcement will mean an extra £850k of business rates! Hardly a wow factor!
@OliverCooper not if you know most PADS will be there for 20yrs+. Also we have offered gov to get money when they do. Still a better deal.
@OliverCooper only by extending allowance period. Will return to 62% after time.
@wallaceme @chrisdeerin there isn't going to be enough sites. In rural areas. Won't shift politics or jobs. Sovereign funds best see norway
Shale Gas gives Gov chance to re-balance Britian.  We could support the North with a real share of revenues
If you consider Treasury will take 63% tax from each shale pad returning business rates to councils is like getting crumbs from the table
@RichardOladi was  a good trip. Members of the Majlis &amp; Gov have to hold together a difficult coalition as do we back home. Vested intrests

Britain spies to protect her citizens AND further her interests. Get over it. So does everyone else including most of Europe.

Good news in Wyre &amp; Preston North CC youth unemployment DOWN 17.5% on the year.
@raefil spin it what ever way you like but the rise in employment is not down to zero hours and part time. Look at stats.
@raefil no comments on success on trade, employment and economy? Or are you sill after plan B? #edballs
@raefil also best way out of poverty is work. Under THIS gov unemployment falling every month despite economic mess we inherited for Labour
@raefil they are rising at a slower rate than they did under Labour.
Dear Mr Snowden, what representations did you make to your Russian hosts about the detention of Greenpeace activists????

@eubetter positive but more as an event organiser than critical player. P5+1 and UN been the main players over yrs
@eubetter grand bargain was before stuxnet &amp; offered much more than agreed today.  West dismissed offer now having to accept less.
Bet the West wishes it had accepted the "grand bargain" offered by Iran back in 2003.
As Chair of APPG on Iran I welcome the deal decided in Geneva. Iran can, if she wants, play a +ve role in the world.
Any signatory of the NPT has a right to pursue civil nuclear tech. That clearly implies they have a right to enrich to get there. #iran
@kmcgeary yes it is one of the very few owned by hedge funds.

@chrisdeerin of course that's why they were allies in the 80's. Iran was happy to take their weapons supplies then.
@NorthernjGooner yes. I will give the MOD a chance...for now. Let's see where we are with numbers!
@Tony_McNulty we need you back Tony! Too many 10 year olds running the show these days!

Ask Iran to Geneva 2 and recognise her right to enrich as implied by NPT and we might get a deal!
@TimMontgomerie irony is Iran as signatory of NPT has right to enrich &amp; pursue nuke power. Israel is not yet refuses inspection of own sites
@TimMontgomerie no they are not. Our policy on Iran has been wrong for a decade.
@TimMontgomerie France is blocking a deal for nothing other than not wanting to diminish its own power in the world.
@NRE_Virgin well done Virgin. All on my carriage south to Euston marked 2 mins after staff announcement.
@chrisdeerin Jeremy Kyle? Too much time....too much time!
@JGForsyth Lancashire MP's have been pressing for Gov to give North more than current 1% on offer! No money - no deal
@GuidoFawkes Richard Gott....
Our spooks keep us safe and risk their lives doing it.
Richard Gott.......
@LucyMPowell we can start by having good local based MP's like yourself. People don't vote for London clones
@tnewtondunn I am referring to society as a whole.
@tnewtondunn wrong in my day we weren't so risk averse and health and safety. We got stuck in. We risked ourselves for evidence.
@tnewtondunn in my day we did it with wit, cunning and fortitude. Control orders were a fudge because politicians wanted to cut corners.
@AbiolaHP @iainmartin1 @patmcfaddenmp Finland is in EU.
@JBeattieMirror lib dems need twice the SPADs so as to be able to face both ways at once!
@tnewtondunn I was trying to reflect reality of the front line. It is not easy to put people under surveillance
@iainmartin1 @patmcfaddenmp I would venture the one thing CBI does know about is trade.
@iainmartin1 @patmcfaddenmp yup.
@iainmartin1 @patmcfaddenmp not on Europe. Without trading blocks in today's global Market UK trade would be hampered.
@raju @ShippersUnbound @juliansambles except for the Guardian! -12% this year.
@chrisdeerin it is classy!
While the Guardian sits as judge and jury on what Snowden intelligence is "safe" to release you might want to ask about Richard Gott.
@bigvaldrewski I assure you that one day we will be wishing the same
The Lib Dems are the whoopee cushion of British politics!
I love our coalition partners. Such courage and determination to up hold the principles of collective government!
In all the Snowden hype there has yet to be a story that shows GCHQ broke the law. Which means Guardian must has no public interest defence
When I worked in aerospace we always knew there were two countries that stole your secrets - the Chinese and the French.
Everyone knows France spies on UK.
@paulwaugh saved by the employer, near destroyed by Unite. The Union that likes to destroy jobs.
Great news for Lancashire yet again manufacturing output grew in Q3!
@SpiegelPeter will France fess up that it spies on its friends?
@raefil lol
@jason_manc @tnewtondunn what we really have a problem with is too many MP's actually live in London rather than where they represent
Deciding Syria's fate without Iranian involvement is a bit like organising a wedding without inviting the groom
@jason_manc true but we also have a problem in most Urban - Bristol, London, Birmingham, etc
@OliverTapple I think Lancashire is the best people in England. That's what I think. Honest, fun, hard graft, good ethos. @tnewtondunn
@tnewtondunn and Peter Kelner's piece is "bollocks"
@tnewtondunn look at North West as key battle ground. The best thing about the North West is how few Lib Dems there are!
@tnewtondunn to talk about the "north" is to display a southerners ignorance. There is the North West, the North East and the Borders.
Or who has a whole Division of their intelligence service devoted to industrial espionage?
Or who bugged EU council negotiation rooms in EU?
Or who stole secrets from Paris airshow in the 90's???
Truly shocked that the French are truly shocked the countries spy! Who could possibly have bugged Air France business class a few years ago?
Wearing a jumper will help cut the need for too much heating AND help my sheep farmers! #britishwool
Its time to split the Met. The SO's should have separate leadership from day to day policing and be separately accountable  #plebgate
@benedictbrogan except Defence. That would be in breach of EU embargo and upset our US deals.
@chrisdeerin know how you feel...know how you feel!
@chrisdeerin can't believe you are heading North!  We need you! At least console yourself that from Stirling you can see Wallace!
@RobbieGibb @afneil Guardian still need to discover a crime in order to have a public interest defence. So far none from Snowden
@BBCRadio4 @chrisdeerin @ChrisLeslieMP #RoyalMail I'd take this up with Lord Mandelson, after all it was under Labour the process started
Vince Cable's comments on Snowden show he puts pandering to Guardian above protection of UK citizens. Guardian still has proven no crime
Just met with Louisiana Senator to hear how they wrestled oil revenue from Fed Gov back to State. Lesson for Shale Gas?
Spending this week in Washington DC lobbying Senators &amp; Congress  on proposed EU - US free trade treaty. Good for Lancs manufacturing &amp; jobs
What could Chris Huhne possibly have against surveillance? He probably thinks GCHQ planted the speed camera!
The Guardian and Glen Greenwald is free anytime to reveal a crime that GCHQ has committed in order to prove public defence
Seriously no one needs to have a go at Ed Milibands Dad. It won't be his father standing. Ed  will make himself unelectable or not.
great news for Lancs;  http://t.co/5Mp0DnJTfs
If you listen to anything this week listen to One to One about fatherhood on BBC Radio 4 #radio4
@DouglasCarswell I'm with you on CGT!
@doghigh answer this. Do you think a criminal allegation against a police crime commiss should get equal billing with another criminal aleg?
@doghigh no doubt you were delighted that it was Labour that started the process of Royal Mail privatisation.
@doghigh what idiotic nonsense you spout.
Curious how big BBC cover  a tory vice chair's arrest but they gave none nationally to Labour's Lancs PCC having his file sent to CPS!
@GiselaStuart @JBeattieMirror #singlepersontax no lectures from the party that taxed pensions &amp; savings and rewarded benefits &amp; debt
@acidkeith @wallaceme @AskLloydsBank if they really wanted to reflect what their customers were thinking perhap they shld start with Bankers
@paulwaugh if Ed Mili, Balls and cooper love the North so much why don't they live here? #primrose hill
@davidblairdt @OborneTweets but the biggest flaw in your AK47 comparison is that not a single component of it can be dual used.
@davidblairdt @OborneTweets which brings us back to why 2 US national Int Estimates are more concerned with intent than anything
@davidblairdt @OborneTweets or Japan that has "breakout capability" but doesn't mean it has Nuke Wep programme.
@davidblairdt e.g. Saudi has tech and missile capability but not uranium although as AQ Khan was sponsored by Saudi money who knows?
@davidblairdt @OborneTweets no you have dodge the point because you refuse to acknowledge that intent is vital part of a complex weapon prog
@davidblairdt @OborneTweets many countries have about 80% of what is needed to make nuclear weapons it is the intent that makes difference.
@davidblairdt @OborneTweets did you know it has two aiming marks on launch pad - Tel Aviv and Tehran?
@davidblairdt @OborneTweets curious why I haven't seen any articles in DT on Saudi ballistic missile programme? Quit advanced now I hear.
@davidblairdt @OborneTweets sorry but you still have to actually take next step of doing the enriching
@davidblairdt @OborneTweets the even UK has sought lots of weapon systems in the past but stopped. Doesn't mean its still a programme.
@davidblairdt no evidence as yet of actual weaponisation, no evidence of testing, or capability. That's is why it is all about intent.
@davidblairdt they aren't as yet seeking the ability. No evidence from IAEA that they have enriched above 20%.
@davidblairdt @OborneTweets your advice has missed the key which is intent. Hence the US National int estimates twice doubtful.
@davidblairdt @OborneTweets your local garden shop has all the ingredients to make high explosives but doesn't mean they have a weapons prog
@davidblairdt @OborneTweets. You clearly are confused by your own piece. Diff btwn AK47 assembly and a nuke is about...2 yrs min.
@AskLloydsBank please could you justify and explain the ridiculous script to your latest ads?
The West must be very careful not to move the goal posts on Iran.
@IsabelHardman Ed Mili's idea of the North is primrose hill.
@IsabelHardman if Labour loves the north so much why do Miliband, Balls, Cooper etc live in London!
@Andrew_Adonis errr and what happened to prices?? As they predicted they went UP
@lucianaberger one major flaw with your point. In California it was about manip of supply capacity both in and out of state. Not same here.
@raefil rubbish
If you think energy co make excessive profits levy a windfall tax and spend money on cutting other duties or taxes. Ed's policy is dangerous
@oxjustice one phrase is about how, we, individuals create and contribute to a state, Ed's version is about how we are servants to the State
So that's what Red Ed means by one nation: "one choice, one owner, one view, one state, one price, one company" all determined by Ed.
@JBeattieMirror not the same as "losing it". One would be confiscation by the State (Red Ed).
If the SNP win 2014 ref England will not be in control of any Gas or Oil! We will have to buy like everyone else in EU!
@EddieBarnes23 how can Miliband promise energy cap when by 2015 if SNP get way England could have no gas of its own?
@ITVLauraK I wonder how the 174,000 workers whose jobs are with or supported by Centrica feel about  tonight? http://t.co/Ss7UIaFxlo
I wonder how the 174,000 workers whose jobs are with or supported by Centrica feel about voting Labour tonight? http://t.co/Ss7UIaFxlo
I am sensing power price freeze policy beginning to defrost rapidly! #unravel
@raefil funnily enough it was Labour who planned our energy storage capacity. Must have been the moratorium on gas stations
This spring we were 2 hrs away from lights going out. Without investment capacity will shrink. So will Ed use taxpayers money to plug gap?
@SansConscience I can't answer for US. I would have taken Iran grand bargain of 2004.
@JBeattieMirror Labour can do better than this!
@chrisdeerin he hasn't had a chat with anyone in the street (outside Primrose Hill) ever.
@afneil will Miliband's grand promise apply to the thousands in rural areas who use oil or bottled gas to heat home?
@bigvaldrewski http://t.co/Lbu30l2Mqk; read for yourself
@bigvaldrewski no it hasn't.
@S_Mehrdad see numerous IAEA reports
@S_Mehrdad and then suspended it
@SansConscience there are many countries subject to Additional protocol. It is also what Iran signed up to in 2004.
Will Labour maintain small business rate relief after 2015? Currently small business below £12k rateable value eligible for up to 100%.
@JZarif the implementation of the NPT additional protocol would be a strong and powerful step by Iran.
McBride under Labour was the rule not the exception. Remember "Good day to bury bad news"
@bigvaldrewski if by failed you mean growth, falling inflation, falling unemployment, falling deficit and falling crime then yes
@bigvaldrewski you can't cut the debt until you cut deficit. Which Labour has opposed all the way! Remember "too fast, too deep?"
@bigvaldrewski I think you will find the deficit is falling. Would the £300m city deal that you welcomed be one of the "failed policies"?
Ed Mili "the only way we can win is in a race to the top" - yup the top of the G20 debt table!
@MissPeelpants yup. Disappointed but shall look forward to sending you the bill for the upkeep
@doghigh if you did your home work you would know HS2 will stop at Preston.
@doghigh @Andrew_Adonis so wrong. Best  is for HS2 to merge on to west coast main 10 miles south of preston. All benefit none of hassle.
Any cheques blank or not from the Bank of Labour will bounce. They spent all the money
#ShareTheFacts about what the Conservatives are doing for hardworking people http://t.co/7NErvQDBEg
@RicHolden so now we know Labour's top priority is not reduce debt, not invest in infastruc, not help exports...it's more benefits!
@TimMontgomerie so at last Labour's 1st policy is not invest in infastruc, not reduce burden on business, or cut debt -  its more benefits!
@MasonHornby home to God's county - Lancashire! Chipping but no Norton!
@Lotus_F1Team thank you Lotus F1 for hosting me and my British MP colleagues at HQ today. A Truly talented and successful team!
Alex Salmond is chicken to debate another Scot on independence.
@Walburgian nope. Listing would be a straight jacket on Preston. It would also stop any plans to adapt bus station
if you really want to help FE &amp; 6th form Colleges give them the same VAT arrangements as schools. #unfair
@paulwaugh in May David Laws MP refused free school meals for 16-18yrs because he said not the money? what's changed? http://t.co/FMocU0I1IR
@_MarkByrne always happy to help. Let me know if you need any further support?
@OborneTweets I am beginning to feel you and I will be proved correct on Iran!
As the economy turns lib dems best bet is to be intertwined with government not exacerbate differences. Poor politics Vince.
@OborneTweets noooooooooooooooooooo!!!
@maurice1941 that's why under last labour gov gap between rich and poor grew more than in previous 18 years under the tories.
@maurice1941 you clearly believe everything the Labour Party tell you!
@tnewtondunn so is it fair to penalise some one who chooses to spend their wealth a house as opposed to other goods?
@maurice1941 Ed Miliband is a millionaire.
@maurice1941 rich pay more tax under this Gov than under last labour one
@maurice1941 you will also discover Labour introduce more privatisation into NHS than any government before or after
@maurice1941 I think you will find it was Mandelson who started the process of Royal mail privatisation! Keep believing the propaganda
@StuartBroadbent doesn't that depend if where the workers come from? If 90% come from Romania or Bulgaria then they don't need them now
@bernieblac @NeilDocking_LEP I think is now being delayed as was imminent. Suspect Minister wants more info!
@NorthernjGooner good try but when I last looked we are in a coalition.
@a_mca and for the record I worked in aerospace before parliament so I know a good union leader from a bad one.
@a_mca actually less than 300 voluntary went. That's the childish scare stories that anger me. Local Unions fix things not the Lens.
@a_mca this time two years ago Union leaders played politics with my constituents jobs. Unite declared 18000 jobs would go!
@maurice1941 so raising the tax free allowance from 8K to 10K?
Answer this. Why can't union members be trusted to opt in to funding Labour Party? Do  Union leaders think they can't think for selves?
@maurice1941 Miliband, Blair, Brown all middle class. Major working class, Thatcher, as well. Tell me who is posh then?
@maurice1941 keeping people in jobs is the opposite of running people down. Best way out of poverty is jobs.
@maurice1941 no my father who grew up in a mining village in fife, orphaned at 16 doesn't. No your right. How could he possibly?
@maurice1941 @IsabelHardman lowest number of work less families since records began. Enough said.
@a_mca the point is Len the Donkey used scare tactics and hysteria on the backs of my constituents to grandstand. He was wrong.
@maurice1941 if Len the donkey had his way you would all be out of job. Fact under tories employment UP; growth UP, Deficit Down; Exports UP
@IsabelHardman local unions worked with management to change work patterns and keep on track - LIONS
@IsabelHardman two years ago Mclusky of UNITE crowed of job losses at BAE in Lancs. In fact there were NO compulsory redundancy. - DONKEY
@jameschappers more Blanch than Flower!
What is going on at Buck House? Security sounds all over place.
@ThatTimWalker or even age over time, like a fine claret? That way I could afford to drink them!
@ConorMWalsh and if I am not mistaken they liked Engles so much renamed their country!
@AndrewSNicoll errrrrr....
@coatesieboy next week. Mon, tues
also some of best paintings in Hermitage were actually Warpole's (Catherine Great bought them 2nd hand).
Putin must have forgot 1st Russian Navy built by Scot Thomas Gordon. Cath Great's chief architect was Scot Charles Cameron (Summer Palace)
@tristanpc they certainly feel under threat religiously, military,and economically. It's why they always ask for security guarantees from us
@tristanpc iran's motives are partly because it lives in rough neighbourhood. Pakistan (nuc) , Saudi (old enemy) ,Afghan (sunni extremists).
@nicholaswatt I think he is a fan?
@Namurian1 it is less than shale pays elsewhere and all I want is HM treasury to take a little less and we in Lancs a little more.
Met with PM today to push for greater revenues from Shale Gas to be retained by Lancashire. We must not let this pass without a fight
@raefil come on PNE!
@raefil so the answer in the theoretical case would have been a.) . And by the way I agree in much of what you say about last resort etc.
@raefil This is not about Syria it's about principle. Are there times when uk mil action can happen without vote? Ever? Self def?
@raefil oh and well done for believing in democracy. We all do. That's why I stood for election.
@raefil no. Democracy doesn't mean you don't have an executive. And therefore there must be some instances when time doesn't permit.
@raefil but I asked you to answer the question. Either you believe military action should always wait for parliament or not in some circumst
@raefil Russia sold them scuds and now  Syria. He has at least 300.
@bigvaldrewski I don't disagree
@raefil answer the question? What would you do?
@bigvaldrewski yes
@raefil so Assad prepares one of his 300 scuds to fire at cyprus on a Saturday. Do you a.) Take action b.) Wait till parliament on monday?
@tnewtondunn if chemical weapons were to be accessible by Jihadists or if Assad were to move military assets to threaten Cyprus
The requirement for a further parliamentary vote on action in Syria should not apply if British security &amp; citizens are under direct threat
@tristanpc it should be. Any PM should reserve the right to take swift action to defend British citizens and security.
@tristanpc ready for another shock? Iran's closet ally during Iran Iraq war was Israel. They supplied arms to Tehran.
@chrisdeerin @RichardJSpencer nd I've never known journalists let facts get in the way of good story either......
@tristanpc little evidence of iran (shia) arming salafist Taliban. Some evidence of drug lords on border playing both sides.
@frasernelson the real question is why in US does "need to know" not seem to exist? Manning &amp; Snowden  low grade but with access all areas!
@rupertmurdoch it is why action was necessary. At very least we need to reduce danger of either side getting hands on Chem Weapons.
@chrisdeerin two years ago Iran alleged that Saudi trained pigeons to spy on their nuclear plants!
@jameschappers oh yes wasn't public opinion against women getting the vote?
@jameschappers if memory serves me well public opinion was for appeasement and against war with Germany
@massiveblunder @chrisdeerin Russia isn't going to sell Chem weapons and Iran doesn't posses.
@TheStaunton the real British national interest is to take every opp to reduce the chem stocks. The jihadist rebels would have them in uk
@massiveblunder @chrisdeerin but if your happy for the 1000 tonnes of nerve gas to fall into either sides hands then do nothing!
@massiveblunder @chrisdeerin even dictators don't like storing gas near supporters (in case they gas them) or enemies in case they use them!
@massiveblunder @chrisdeerin 1stly Chem weapons stocks centralised in two stockpile sites (418 &amp; 417) frm Dec 2012
@chrisdeerin he is wrong because he believes we could not of degraded the chemical stocks. We could have.
@tristanpc it was the Iranians who helped the US bring down the Taliban in 2002.
There can be no peace in Syria without involving Iran
@speedofflight yup
@HassanRouhani will you, Mr Rouhani, allow Mr Straw and myself to visit?
@iainmartin1 @DPJHodges I suspect Labour will say "all is fair in love and war"
Helping in the Harvest. Long way from Westminster! ...until tomorrow worse luck! http://t.co/VQ7O7ZxVq5
@ADBremner @LucyMPowell no but we need a faster route TO Leeds. Its not all about London
Balls on HS2 "there'll be no blank cheque from Labour" - yup that's because they would bounce
If UK unable to detect danger abroad because Snowden &amp; gang expose Intel not motivated by injustice but by sensationalism then shame on them
Guardian story remains a process one because they have yet to publish a Snowden "revelation" that warrants a public interest defence.
@MichaelWhite until Guardian can show info that warrants public interest defence the story will remain a process one.
@nicholaswatt @ThatTimWalker irony is in Russia where Snowden is hiding there is no press freedom &amp; Gays persecuted! That is real hypocrisy
@nicholaswatt @ThatTimWalker if no laws by GCHQ broken what is public interest defence?
