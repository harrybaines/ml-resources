This weekend I went to @howlettspark where I met Saba the cheetah who will soon be released into the wild. He nibbled my hat. You can see I was totally calm and at ease...Tomorrow in the @Telegraph I’ve written about the incredible work the @aspinallcharity are doing https://t.co/7XQnYXXx2c
If John McDonnell had the slightest knowledge of history he would be aware that Churchill also had an extraordinary record as a social reformer who cared deeply for working people and their lives. JM should be utterly ashamed of his remarks and withdraw them forthwith 2/2
Winston Churchill saved this country and the whole of Europe from a barbaric fascist and racist tyranny and our debt to him is incalculable 1/2
We must extricate this country from the humiliation of the backstop. However we must be clear - there is no point having a time limit on the backstop unless that is written into the treaty itself and unless the end date falls before the next general election https://t.co/5WKL5B0k0X
Very glad to see Govt working on this https://t.co/ChEWIAe8wX
Delighted to visit Sunflower House Nursery in Uxbridge! A real pleasure to meet Diane and all her team who do such a fantastic job. https://t.co/OhPvmUYliT
Delighted to see that @RhysConcessao has been awarded a place with the National Youth Orchestra. One of Uxbridge’s finest is using his wonderful musical talents on the piano to join the prestigious NYO! https://t.co/imltYKgHmZ
Eleven years ago the Met instituted Operation Blunt 2 - taking 11,000 knives off the streets of London. This led to a serious fall in knife crime &amp; the murder rate. The present Mayor now claims it will take 10 years to solve rising knife crime. This is simply not good enough https://t.co/G5dD8l2PYb

Fantastic to see local businesses like @GibbsGillespie doing so well - completed a full refurbishment of their offices and invested heavily in staff development for great customer service! https://t.co/M8ySWsnFFR
Delighted hundreds of my constituents are sharing the @PostcodeLottery prize pot today. It's a fantastic boost for the community &amp; local charities in Uxbridge &amp; South Ruislip are securing funding too which is great!
Productive meeting with new @HillingdonNHSFT Chief Exec, Sarah Tedford yesterday to discuss her plans for Hillingdon Hospital - will be working hard to bring forward much needed improvements. https://t.co/1MbWtsj48Q
We can’t have some codicil or letter or joint declaration. We need to go back into the text of the treaty and solve the problem. That is the way to unite remainers and leavers in the Conservative party and across the country 2/2
If the Prime Minister indicates in the debate that she will be pressing Brussels to reopen the WA to make changes to the backstop, I will gladly support the Brady amendment. But what we need is to achieve something legally binding - and that means part of the WA 1/2
If the PM is ready to fight back against Brussels then her deal could yet be fixed - but it will need the Freedom Clause   https://t.co/F1ixr3oGyu
Today we all remember the horrors that took place during the Holocaust. It is by remembering that we can ensure such evil never happens again. @HolocaustUK https://t.co/9KotoaKA8Q
The PM must go back to Brussels and either insist the backstop is removed entirely, or at the very least give us a legally binding change – within the text of the withdrawal agreement – that allows for the UK to come out of its own accord https://t.co/gBVCC8in33
There are large numbers of MPs (though not, I think, a majority) who want to stop Brexit. They want to frustrate the will of the people, but there are three giant facts that mean – or so I hope and believe – that they will fail  https://t.co/VjgPFUrCSa
Extending Article 50 now would do nothing but erode trust in politics. We must leave as promised on March 29th. The Government should go back to Brussels, ditch the backstop and aim for a #BetterDeal https://t.co/3LV7RmtjH0
There is nothing to be gained by delay and legislation should be brought forward immediately to protect them and their families - exactly as intended in the draft withdrawal agreement that has been rejected by parliament 2/2
Totally agree with @annietrev - it would be completely wrong to keep EU nationals in any more suspense. They cannot be used as UK negotiating capital and they deserve clarity forthwith 1/2
Tonight has made it clear that the current Withdrawal Agreement is dead. The government must now go back to Brussels and negotiate a #BetterDeal without the backstop https://t.co/l8Xd3ogCa1
When this deal is voted down, let us not continue to flog this dead horse. Instead we must get brexit right and seize the opportunities before us https://t.co/AosSRdSclS
A very good insight into the EU negotiators - and surely makes this deal utterly indefensible https://t.co/6nn67NXj7A
Well deserved, @JohnnyMercerUK https://t.co/UYaDB9FbXo

Great meeting Rich Blake-Lobb at Yiewsley Baptist Church today to discuss local issues in Yiewsley and future community projects for 2019. https://t.co/EXHXduJUob
We are told that the EU does not even like the backstop. Well, if the EU doesn’t like it, and the UK government doesn’t like it, and the British people don’t like it, why on earth is it there? Let us get rid of it and move on  https://t.co/3fLL0isC4v
Everyone can see the hideous choice that this deal imposes on this country: to accept law from Brussels – with no say – or else to accept the break up of the UK.  We must and can do much better   https://t.co/P3XEJzM3CD
Deal is merely licence for the EU to bully and blackmail us - we must reject it  https://t.co/EWDatcigQ1
The PM says she wants to let Parliament choose whether to enter the backstop or extend the 'transition'. This is simply not possible. Under her deal the EU has the legal right to stop us extending the transition and make us enter the backstop - whatever the PM or Parliament says
https://t.co/0q6boZ8bVP
Essential reading by Mervyn King   https://t.co/4E32fVsRgl
The public is entitled to see the legal advice from the Attorney General to the Prime Minister. It is a scandal that this is currently being withheld. It must be released  https://t.co/PtU3bpaXDW
Once the EU realises that they have overplayed their hand &amp; Parliament won’t wear this shameful surrender, they will be faced with a choice: do a proper &amp; equitable deal or split without a deal - a prospect that they don’t relish, not least as they lose all leverage over us 4/4
Once those with whom you are negotiating believe that, then it simply becomes a matter of how long they want to make their Christmas list 3/4
What is different about this negotiation is one simple fact: the EU believed that despite her ‘No Deal is Better than a Bad Deal’ rhetoric, Theresa May was desperate for a deal at any price 2/4
Those who say that it’s impossible to get a better deal from the EU than Theresa May’s deal - that the EU has rules as immutable as those of the Medes and the Persians - have obviously never seen the horse trading and back room compromises that characterise every EU summit 1/4
Thank you @ConSocBrunel for a great afternoon at Brunel University! https://t.co/he79K4Fp3o
Delighted to meet Simon who has spent two years researching, developing and formulating his products for UXB Skincare. Each one is now made by hand in Uxbridge. It’s this passion and dedication that makes small businesses stand out #SmallBusinessSaturday #ShopLocal https://t.co/8o3ZSjoCb6
Yesterday I went out across my constituency to speak to small businesses to hear what support they most need. From the cake baker in Ruislip to the barber in Uxbridge, these businesses are what make our high streets so great @SmallBizSatUK https://t.co/bJ2k6wYZjf

The world economy is changing. The opportunities for a dynamic modern economy like the UK are growing. Free from the corporatist EU, its anti-innovation decisions, &amp; its rule by vested interests, we will grow, not decline - and the freer we are the more we will prosper
The British economic establishment always gets it wrong. Wrong about joining the ERM, wrong about leaving it, wrong about joining the Euro, wrong about Project Fear after the referendum.  They can't forecast six months out - why should we believe them over 15 years?
There is no point having a debate with two people who voted Remain &amp; deals that don’t take back control. Any debate must involve someone who believes in Brexit &amp; the British people being fully in control of their laws, rather than giving back control to the EU like the PM's deal
Debates are great for democracy - but rather than widening discourse, this debate is narrowing it by offering a false choice between May’s failing deal and Corbyn’s vague proposals - neither of which are Brexit 1/2
While half the Cabinet is telling businesses the UK will effectively remain in the Customs Union &amp; Single Market, the PM continues to say we will take back control of our laws, vary our tariffs &amp; be able to do real free trade deals. They can’t both be right. Which is it? https://t.co/RdreeZRZFS
We should vote down the deal, junk the backstop, recover our self-belief and go for SuperCanada – and we will thrive mightily  https://t.co/2YB93j7B7A
Our hopes of ending the barbaric trade of sending live animals abroad for slaughter will almost certainly be dashed by the appalling sell-out Brexit deal   https://t.co/bcIAH88Bbh
Nothing in this political declaration changes the fact that this deal gives the EU a continuing veto over the unilateral power over the entire U.K. to do trade deals or take back control of our laws. We must junk the backstop or we make a nonsense of Brexit https://t.co/VrFdn4zKGR
We should insist that our government finally gets behind Brexit and shows some basic confidence and enthusiasm and belief in this great project  https://t.co/JHp2eGuDRs
Sabine Weyand in The Times clear: if agreed, the CU backstop will not be temporary but the minimum basis for our future trading relationship, with high alignment and 'EU control' - this means super-canada impossible.  Cabinet must live up to its responsibilities &amp; stop this deal
We still have time to go for something better - a SuperCanada free trade deal that will allow the UK to benefit from brexit and actually respect the referendum. The future can be bright if only we change course now 2/2
No one is fooled by this theatre. Delay after staged managed delay. A deal will be reached and it will mean surrender by the UK. We will be doomed to remain in the customs union and under Brussels’ regulatory control. People did not vote for colony status 1/2
https://t.co/NKxlPuOGzN
All power to Xavier Brice and sustrans in pushing for a massive upgrade in the UK cycle network. Xavier did fantastic work for London and it is good to see him campaigning to bring rural safety up to urban levels
We will always remember those who made the greatest possible sacrifice to defend our freedom  #RemembranceSunday #ArmisticeDay100
This is not taking back control. It is a surrender of control. It does not remotely correspond to the mandate of the people in June 2016    2/2
Boundless admiration as ever for my brother Jo. We may not have agreed about brexit but we are united in dismay at the intellectually and politically indefensible of the UK position 1/2 https://t.co/QI4tMpLecc
Brexit was meant to be about taking back control. Under this plan – we surrender control to Brussels. If we accept this appalling deal, we must realise it is forever – not just for Christmas.  https://t.co/7ziGjnmhc2
Tragic news about Sir Jeremy Heywood. He was an absolutely brilliant public servant and a model of dedication to his country

Knife crime in our capital has now hit a record high -  @sadiqkhan is failing Londoners and urgently needs to get a grip   https://t.co/Aij5z9qnYf
We must be clear that we can genuinely vary our tariffs and do free trade deals or it will be Brexit in name only and we will betray the British people. A deadline is essential https://t.co/PyibdhI6CB
After more than two years of being ruthlessly pushed around by the EU, it is time for the UK to resist.   https://t.co/jMZbK4g6lA
This is far from #TakeBackControl. In the referendum both sides said Leave meant leaving the customs union &amp; single market. Yet this backstop inevitably means chequers, staying in both, no say in either, and no right to escape. No10 must #ChuckChequers now 4/4
This backstop closes off our options. It means we cannot have no deal / WTO or SuperCanada. Under either our rules could differ from the EU’s – so they will keep us in the backstop instead. It means, in fact, that the only possible deal is Chequers 3/4
This backstop keeps the UK in the Customs Union, keeps Northern Ireland in the single market, and almost certainly enhances NI/GB checks. It *will* apply after 2020 unless the EU agrees it won’t. And they will only agree if we keep our rules in lockstep with theirs 2/4
This is an important moment. Clearly No10 are negotiating a “backstop” that makes the UK a permanent EU colony. We cannot escape EU laws &amp; ECJ until they allow us to – which they may never do. That’s not what the biggest majority in our history voted for #NoColonyStatus 1/4
Very pleased to hear no one hurt in fire @Bruneluni - many thanks to the London Fire Brigade and the University for their swift response ensuring the safety of all students. https://t.co/Q3atVv7Jbv

There are 200m women who have been victims of FGM. Not only do they sometimes bleed to death; there could be no more vile &amp; powerful way of showing a young girl that she is a lesser person - a chattel - than attacking this fundamental part of her identity  https://t.co/0zpNBzQEw6
We may disagree on some important policy issues but @sarahwollaston is a true one nation Tory. It's important to have people who speak their mind in our party   https://t.co/kLJXSIiDlZ
But the first step to achieving a mutually beneficial SuperCanada deal is the removal of the Irish backstop so there is no threat to the Union whatsoever.
Tusk’s Canada +++ offer shows there is a superb way forward that can solve the Irish border problem and deliver a free trade based partnership that works well for both sides of the channel - as I set out last week in my plan for a better brexit   https://t.co/qSxC4nnReR

Good to have Andargachew Tsege back on UK soil after his pardon by the Ethiopian government. Very proud of the hard work @foreignoffice staff put into supporting him and his family to get him home safely.
Appalled to see another vocal Russian journalist, Arkady Babchenko, murdered. My thoughts are with his wife and young daughter. We must defend freedom of speech and it is vital that those responsible are now held to account.
Just spoken to Bill Browder – very glad that he has now been released. Moscow should concentrate on bringing those responsible for the murder of #Magnitsky to justice
Fully support Australian and Dutch request to Russia to accept state responsibility for its role in the downing of flight MH17. Vital Russia now cooperates to deliver justice for victims of this tragedy, which killed 298 people including 10 Brits.  https://t.co/r4LPfyQfiL

Jeremy Corbyn has been abandoned in many leave areas – his pledge to stay in the customs union means he is not trusted to deliver Brexit. PM’s clear Mansion House vision for leaving the single market and customs union a key part of Tory electoral success 3/3
I would also like to pay personal tribute to Ray Puddifoot and all the incredible @Hillingdon_Tory team for holding and increasing the majority despite everything that Labour threw at them 2/3

Important moment in Parliament today as ‘Magnitsky’ provisions targeted at gross human rights violators are added to Sanctions Bill. These will allow UK to act against those responsible for serious offences worldwide. UK stands up for human rights globally.
Israeli PM’s speech on Iran’s past nuclear weapons research shows why we need Iran Nuclear deal. Iran deal based not on trust but verification, allowing @iaeaorg unprecedented access. Need to keep deal &amp; build on it to take account of US &amp; allies’ concerns https://t.co/To50dEs3zM
Really sad to lose @AmberRuddHR from Cabinet. A fine colleague who did a great job during last year's terrorist attacks and cares deeply about the people she serves.

Very disappointed to hear Burmese @Reuters journalists Kyaw Soe Oo and Wa Lone are now to face trial. Reiterate my calls for their release: Burmese authorities must show their commitment to media freedom.
Hugely disappointing that Russia vetoed the proposal at the UN for an independent investigation into Syrian chemical attacks. Russia is holding the Syrian people to political ransom by supporting a regime responsible for at least 4 heinous chemical attacks against its people
The murder of 5 rangers &amp; driver in DRC’s Virunga National Park is simply tragic. Brave rangers work tirelessly in DRC to serve their communities and protect endangered wildlife, putting their lives at risk to protect species like the mountain gorilla from extinction https://t.co/4KTMG2GZTA

@ZacGoldsmith @musebiihi @NimkoAli No woman should be subjected to FGM.  It is violent and harmful.  I advocate an end to all forms of FGM worldwide.
Grim reports of large scale chemical weapons attack vs innocent civilians in Syria. If confirmed Syrian regime responsible, more evidence of Asad's brutality and disregard for Syrian people. Russia must not yet again try to block investigation into CW use  https://t.co/NxWmZGoY8h
I welcome the US taking further decisive action against Russian malign state activity by sanctioning more Russian entities with Kremlin links. The international community continues to show that persistent Russian hostility will be tolerated no longer.
Sergei Skripal’s improved condition is both great news, and testament to the quick work of our world-class emergency services and NHS staff, who have been paramount to his and Yulia’s recovery. I thank all involved and wish Sergei &amp; Yulia a quick return to full health.
Yesterday, Russia failed to persuade OPCW that they, the chief suspect, should join an investigation of attempted assassinations in Salisbury. Today’s gambit is to rope the UN Security Council into their disinformation campaign. The world will see through this shameless cynicism
Decisive @OPCW vote against Russian attempts to obscure &amp; confuse is a demonstration of support for UK. We share @OPCW vision of a world free from chemical weapons – attacks like Salisbury &amp; Khan Sheikhoun should never happen again https://t.co/rQrHNHrll6 https://t.co/id1Etm03lp
28 other countries have been so convinced by UK case they have expelled Russians.  In contrast, Jeremy Corbyn chooses to side with the Russian spin machine.
1) Porton Down identified nerve agent as military grade Novichok; 2) Russia has investigated delivering nerve agents,likely for assassination,&amp; as part of this programme has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichoks; 3) Russia has motive for targeting Sergei Skripal.
It is lamentable that Jeremy Corbyn is now playing Russia’s game and trying to discredit the UK over Salisbury attack.  Let’s remember the key facts:

Corbyn’s Brexit plan would leave U.K. a colony of the EU - unable to take back control of our borders or our trade policy. White flag from labour before talks even begin.
Crumbling Corbyn betrays Leave voters - and all because he wants to win a commons vote. Cynical and deluded.
Sensational scoop about Churchill and Doris - but in no way diminishes his standing or the message of his life today.
I welcome unanimous adoption of #UN Security Council Resolution 2401 on #Syria today. Humanitarian aid and medical evacuations urgently needed across Syria, but particularly Eastern Ghouta. Those with influence over the regime must now ensure ceasefire is implemented in full.

Deeply concerned by reports that schoolgirls have been abducted in Nigeria – UK urgently following up with Nigerian authorities. Attacks on schools are abhorrent and must stop. Every girl deserves a safe education.
Borough Commander assures me they are responding to recent knife crime with extra patrols and activity in schools. He is hoping for arrests soon and points out that Uxbridge and S Ruislip still a low crime area. Burglary rates have fallen every month for the last six months

Great scheme @NCS. So very important to equip children with financial and budgeting skills for the future! https://t.co/xgqdIoODwz
2/2 Staying in the customs union means effectively staying in the EU: the EU *is* a customs union.  It means no new free trade deals, no new export opportunities, and no leading role in the WTO.
1/2 Makes no sense for @cbitweets to keep calling to stay in customs union.  PM was clear in Florence speech we are leaving.  Brexit means taking control of laws, borders, money, and trade.  I’m confident British business can profit from the new opportunities. https://t.co/SWi3GnpSlN

Lovely sunny day on the streets of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. It's been the greatest honour to be your MP. I hope you re elect me on June 8 https://t.co/Fcn3FGH0ph
Corbyn no plan for Brexit. Wouldn't answer questions. Can't say he'd defend our country. Denying his past.
Clear win for PM. Clear plan for Brexit. Not afraid to tackle difficult issues and answer the questions.
Corbyn won't admit IRA were terrorists. Won't admit they killed a lot of people
Very very very clear - Corbyn will never protect us against our enemies.
Corbyn asked how he would respond to UK being threatened by nuclear attack. No answer that made any sense - Clearly he would do nothing
Corbyn thinks last Labour government that wrecked the economy and wrote letter saying all money gone didn't spend enough!
Small business face tax rises under Labour. Corbyn will hike taxes to highest level since WW2. We are supporting business and cutting tax
Corbyn sneered at a man who runs a small business when he said he has 5 employees. Backbone of the country you Marxist! Shame on you.
Corbyn asked is he would rule out and SNP coalition. Waffle waffle blah blah. Of course he would and that would damage Brexit opportunities
Corbyn first question an easy one - what will he do on Brexit.Doesn't mention immigration. That's because he knows it will go up with Labour
PM not ducking Qs on tough decisions. We can only look after the country with a strong economy + good Brexit deal. Only Theresa can deliver
This is a PM for the whole country. No matter if you voted Leave or Remain she will get best deal for whole U.K + seize great opportunities
I have seen PM in cabinet and in global negotiations. She is strong + fights hard for UK. Corbyn has never fought for Britain and never will
PM doesn't duck hard decisions. She wants a great Brexit future full of optimism. Only Theresa can go and fight for Britain
Campaigning in London today. People very worried about Labour's Garden Tax + Inheritance Tax plans. Tories the ones delivering lower taxes
Just asked Thornberry how Labour will cut immigration. Erm ahhh umm eeeee ermm. No plan!
Emily Thornberry just said there's no Garden Tax in Labour's manifesto. Lie - search for value land tax and it's there. It will clobber you!
Thornberry just said in our Sun debate Labour would keep us in EU. If you don't leave single market + customs union you don't leave the EU.
Theresa May stands up for all and stands against intolerance. We are proud of Jewish communities - Labour very poor record on anti-Semitism. https://t.co/DBMEeMsnot
Again, Corbyn didn't mention the most important issue for our future - Brexit #sendforhisipad #BBCDebate
Amber is spot on - Theresa will deliver for UK. She's the only leader who will get best Brexit deal #BBCDebate
Come on Jezza, you talk about leadership but yet again you don't mention Brexit #BBCDebate
Here's leadership: imagine Corbyn in charge where 2/3 of his MPs don't support him #BBCDebate
Amber lays out the facts – crime is down by a third #BBCDebate
The risks of Corbyn becoming PM, in charge of our Brexit negotiations and our security, are enormous #BBCDebate
Again, the only way we can invest in our public services and our NHS is by having a strong economy #BBCDebate
And Jezza's #magicmoneytree is back out again #BBCDebate
The only way we can invest in our public services is by building a strong economy – and the key to that is getting Brexit right #BBCDebate
There you have it folks - a horrifying glimpse into the shambolic coalition of chaos that would put Jeremy Corbyn into No.10 #BBCDebate
For those watching #BBCDebate that is what a #coalitionofchaos looks like: no clear plan, squabbling, taxes whacked up + no Brexit deal
Come on Jezza - answer the question https://t.co/UBwXIPHmie
There you go folks - Jezza can't say he would control immigration #BBCDebate
Leaving the EU means we can control and reduce immigration. Leaked document today showed Corbyn would scrap immigration controls #BBCDebate
Corbyn needs to check his ipad again - he thinks the deficit's up; it's down 2/3 of GDP. Can you imagine him negotiating Brexit? #BBCDebate
The IFS say Corbyn’s tax hikes would cost jobs and investment #BBCDebate
As Amber says we have done hard work in govt to deliver more jobs - 2.9m since 2010 #BBCDebate
Corbyn still hasn't mentioned Brexit - only Theresa May can get the best deal for this country #BBCDebate
Farron would join forces in a coaltion of chaos to whack up your taxes - from inheritance, income and introduce a garden tax #BBCDebate
Corbyn said today he would talk to the SNP the day after the election #BBCDebate
Took Corbyn less than 60 seconds to talk about higher taxes - no mention of Brexit #bbcdebate
Amber spot on - the choice is Corbyn and a coalition of chaos or Theresa May making a successful Brexit  #bbcdebate
Great chat with the hardworking and decent people of Uxbridge + South Ruislip. I hope I can proudly serve you again after June 8 https://t.co/Lwn6k1ZmGG
Appalled by #KabulExplosion today during #Ramadan. I condemn those behind this cruel attack. We stand with #Afghanistan against terrorism
Great to meet the Derby Telegraph team with our candidate Amanda Solloway https://t.co/98sW2FwJir
PM showed her mettle on Brexit negotiations just now. Getting that right is central to everything #BattleForNumber10
PM won hands down: measured and ANSWERED the questions in detail #BattleForNumber10
PM "It is a q of what is going to be the right deal for us: to give us control of our money, our borders &amp; our laws" #BattleForNumber10
Only the PM can deliver on Brexit and get the best deal for the UK #BattleForNumber10
We need to be strong &amp; united to get the best from Brexit - the other parties want to mess up Brexit, risking our future #BattleForNumber10
The PM respects the will of the British people and will make a success of Brexit #BattleForNumber10
Only the PM can get the best Brexit deal #BattleForNumber10
Jezza was dodging questions &amp; denying his past. We need a PM who’ll stand up &amp; make the tough decisions - that’s Theresa #BattleForNumber10
As the PM says, she has a plan and only she can get the best possible deal in the Brexit discussions #BattleForNumber10
Jezza was dodging questions all over the place. PM has been answering it straight #BattleForNumber10
Strong, clear and honest answer on social care from the PM - don’t listen to Corbyn’s scare campaign #BattleForNumber10
Strong opener from the PM #BattleForNumber10
We have protected police budget and Corbyn’s team wanted to cut it by 10% #BattleForNumber10
You saw it at first hand folks. Corbyn hasn't got the guts + courage to take the tough decisions and keep us safe #BattleForNumber10
Corbyn won’t strike against ISIS attack planning! Can’t have this weak jelly as PM #BattleForNumber10
Again Corbyn is dodging answering the question and can't answer if he will reduce immigration #BattleForNumber10
Paxo is right - when the Brexit talks begin the EU leaders will have Jezza for breakfast #battlefornumber10
More porkies from the Corbinator - first said he wrote the manifesto, now he’s saying he didn't #BattleForNumber10
Slippery Jezza dodging the question again - he doesn’t believe in renewing Trident and would risk our national security  #BattleForNumber10
Don't trust Corbyn when it comes to defence and he dodged the questions on Trident #battlefornumber10
Jezza says this is about rejigging the economy - yeah right. Him in power = higher taxes, fewer jobs, more debt #BattleForNumber10
Jezza talks about leadership. Here's his leadership for you: 2 / 3 of his MPs dont back him #battlefornumber10
Folks - remember what Corbyn said in 2011: I’ve been involved in opposing anti-terror legislation ever since...1983’  #battlefornumber10
Amber tearing old Barry what's his name apart. Labour wrong on policing + security. Corbyn tried to justify last weeks attack. Shameful! https://t.co/qaoIw6rcEP
In a Sky interview Labour couldn't answer my question - do they want a second EU ref and would they reduce immigration? What a joke! https://t.co/Uh10T8iIOo
I genuinely think it is important people know Corbyn claimed in recent days he never met the IRA. You cannot trust this man! https://t.co/vyP6fUo0iw
A lovely sunny day with the wonderful people of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. Have a great bank holiday weekend all! https://t.co/5JOLlBk84z
Strong performance by PM @theresa_may w/@afneil. There are 17 days to polling day – let’s back her to get Brexit right and secure our future
11 days after the election the EU wants to start Brexit negotiations - it’ll be @theresa_may or @jeremycorbyn. Only @theresa_may can deliver https://t.co/CseULwBnAY
PM @theresa_may gets it spot on - there’s a £58 billion black hole in Corbyn’s manifesto that you’ll pay for with higher taxes and more debt
Strong and clear from the Prime Minister @theresa_may on social care - so older people don't have to worry about cost of care @afneil
https://t.co/TPnZXrCdgz
Morning folks. Here's my piece in Mail on Sunday. Only Theresa May can get the best Brexit deal. Corbyn would be eaten alive by EU team

Spot on Gover and great appeal at the end! Bravo #VoteLeave #InOrOut
Gove quite right about housing pressures - they have unquestionably been increased by immigration #VoteLeave #InOrOut
Even though our energy costs much higher than elsewhere. Take back control and we could correct Miliband policy #VoteLeave #InOrOut
Steelworkers should vote for Brexit. Mad that we can't cut steel energy costs because of EU rules (1/2) #VoteLeave #InOrOut
Vienna Treaty protects rights of UK residents in France and elsewhere in EU! Brexit will make no difference #VoteLeave #InOrOut

You can be pro immigration but also pro control. Keep going Gover. Take back control #VoteLeave #InOrOut
Exactly right Michael Gove. The current immigration policy is massively lopsided #VoteLeave #InOrOut
The Gover spot on about the rebate. At this rate the rebate will go + in any case we send £10bn a year net! We never see it again! #InOrOut
And remember the 364 economists inc 2 Nobel prize winners who attacked Mrs T in 1981 #VoteLeave #InOrOut

This is the moment to finally decide and these are the questions I pose, humbly and respectfully. https://t.co/wttmiNfYtD
TfL have confirmed @SadiqKhan has a £2bn black hole in his plans - meaning any promise he makes on transport is meaningless. #ESHustings
We should all denounce this week’s Tube strike – but Sadiq Khan won’t. Come on, Khan: man up. https://t.co/WK2bmxsNxE
On @daily_politics - @sadiqkhan your fares experiment doesn't add up = £2b black hole/threatens transport investment for 8.5m Londoners
We want, need and deserve these companies to pay more tax in the UK. King Kong vs. Godzilla. Which side are we on?  https://t.co/Br62JlwCOW
Sadiq Khan won't condemn the latest Tube Strikes - here's how you can help stop him: https://t.co/3IanpoBBQ6
Ken Livingstone bowed to the unions, Sadiq Khan would do the same: https://t.co/FrBYB9ZZXs
Incredibly Sadiq Khan won't condemn this pointless strike. Massive support amongst Londoners for the night tube. He is stuck in the past.

We are on the side of workers, and will change the law so that no one earning the minimum wage will pay income tax. http://t.co/TL3loo0gLF
.@Conservatives have a brilliant record on apprenticeships - nationally and here in London. Under a future Tory govt we will have 3m more.
Solid stuff from the PM - on Europe, homes, jobs &amp; national security. @Conservatives are the only party offering leadership for the country.
Hugely optimistic and positive speech from Dave, setting out the @Conservatives' plan for the next 5 years.
.@Conservatives have a fantastic record and story to tell. Let's build on progress made and secure an even brighter future for our country​.
Poor Mili. Even his old comrade Lord Digby Jones has slammed Labour's economics saying they don't add up. #milishambles
No commitment of 4 nuclear subs eh? Already started your coalition negotiations with the SNP, Ed?
Mili won't say that they borrowed too much last time. Why hand the keys of the car back to the Thelma and Louise of British politics?
Same old Balls, #SameOldLabour. They promised strict rules on borrowing in 1997 and look where that got us. http://t.co/snOtAtEET9
The @Conservatives are helping huge numbers of people to pass on a little bit more to their children - supporting a natural human instinct.
Why won't Labour sign up to plugging the #NHS spending gap? Because they want to keep health "weaponised". Shabby.
Fantastic to meet local residents with my team at three street surgeries in Uxbridge and South Ruislip. http://t.co/wBXhCmF08M
Great debate tonight in Uxbridge. Well chaired by Paul Johnson (absolutely no relation).
Next stop was Harrow with @HannahDavid_HW and her army of supporters. http://t.co/J247Im5FPP
Friendly reception when out with @votebobblackman at Belmont Circle. Even the hairdressers enticed me to take a seat. http://t.co/g0YfgnGfCl
Great news the @Conservatives are to freeze fares at RPI - as we have in London for the past two years.
Fantastic to be out with @BackBarwell​ this morning - a top bloke who has worked incredibly hard for Croydon. http://t.co/nNdcghvhLG
Great to be out campaigning with @scullyp in Sutton on this beautiful day. https://t.co/H5rWFUWgfF
I'm two stone heavier but I cleared the plate. http://t.co/2eL9kc36qv
Lunch with my friend @BackBarwell after a morning campaigning. Thanks to Manuel Garcia at the new cafe in Addiscombe. http://t.co/LDaR9R8Cpx
.@votejamesberry is setting a cracking pace in New Malden - campaigning for high-speed improvements and Crossrail 2. http://t.co/8YpdzYqxFi
A red line? Britain’s defences are not something to be bartered away. http://t.co/uJTNcGhur4
We cannot allow Labour to #BallsUp our national security. Defence of the realm is far too important. http://t.co/7ebGWbjBQT
Vote Mike Freer for a freer Finchley and Golders Green. See our video: https://t.co/1fQEHq7tHz
Tories represent the whole of Britain and are the only party taking the country forward. http://t.co/lRvgMDex4C
Great to be out with @nickdebois​, a fantastic local campaigner for Enfield North. https://t.co/UccuukZxgc
Literally an amazing #BallsUp. http://t.co/bgFP2z1TKx
Sturgeon would eat Mili for breakfast and break our great union of nations. http://t.co/5g4sFJEQuL
Blair to rescue Mili? Non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis.
Blair is wrong. Britain can lead reform in the EU - and only the Tories have a plan.
If NY's former Mayor wants my job in the greatest city on earth I'd welcome it but first we need to stop Ed Miliband: http://t.co/gMLlpCg7m9
Some sage advice from @LouiseMensch on @ConHome about what to read during #GE2015: http://t.co/Nb1rANQPrv
From today over 26 million people will keep more of their hard-earned money. Go to http://t.co/MCKjn9IrzL to see how much you save. #taxcuts
Conservatives cut taxes. Labour will raise them. http://t.co/jwQhugbWLa
Happy Easter everyone!
Labour failed to build enough during the boom. We have built record numbers and will do more. #housing
The chaos that might enfold us vs the competence and clarity of the PM at last night's #leadersdebate: https://t.co/hrnZKvZ81Q
I agree with Dave. #leadersdebate http://t.co/UPyCEHi2z3
David Cameron the only one who sounded like a leader with a plan for Britain. #cameronincharge #leadersdebate
Miliband patently insincere and faintly alarming - Cameron in control; whiff of sulphur about Nige. #cameronincharge
DC won. Miles ahead. In control. Strong leader. #leadersdebate
Dave owns Mili on Labour hypocrisy - Doncaster Labour council use zero hours contracts for heaven's sake​. #JustNotUpToIt #leadersdebate
Miliband has bored on about zero hours contracts all night - he would destroy jobs. #JustNotUpToIt #leadersdebate
Tories have built record numbers of affordable homes in London. #leadersdebate
Miliband policy a disaster for higher education - and rejected by sensible labour MPs​. #JustNotUpToIt #leadersdebate
Cameron is completely in control - imagine the others negotiating with the leaders of Europe. #leadersdebate
Well done Clegger for asking for an apology from Mili - not that we'll get one. #saysorryed #leadersdebate
Miliband lecturing people on debt? Really? #JustNotUpToIt #leadersdebate
More #militripe about homes - Tories have built more council homes in 5 years than Labour in 13. #leadersdebate
From Labour, with love. #nomoneyleft #leadersdebate http://t.co/nig3xwW2mG
Greens want an EU Referendum!! Natalie much more dynamic than Mr #JustNotUpToIt Ed.
Farage says there is nothing we can do - well we certainly can't if Labour get in​. #voteukipgetmiliband #leadersdebate
Backdoor Nige would let Miliband migrate into Downing Street. #voteukipgetmiliband #leadersdebate
How many immigrants would Farage turn away? Not at all clear what he is really saying. #leadersdebate
Ridiculous now for Labour to sound tough on immigration when they deliberately opened the floodgates​. #leadersdebate
Dave easily the best and most balanced in the first half, especially on NHS debate. #leadersdebate
Mili can't answer on Mid Staffs cover up. #JustNotUpToIt
Ed caught out on NHS privatisation #justnotuptoit #leadersdebate
PM: "Money spent on doctors not bureaucrats​" - totally right. #leadersdebate
Great point about 7 day NHS service from Cameron - and only with a strong economy to fund it . #leadersdebate
Come on then Miliband tell us what you would cut you cowardy custard. #leadersdebate
Becoming ever clearer that SNP would tilt Labour even further left - behold the chaos that might enfold us. #leadersdebate
Again Mili says he would make cuts - on what and on whom? Cameron zapped him on Labour tax increases. #leadersdebate
How is Mili going to cut the deficit? He can't say...blank nonsense. #militripe #leadersdebate
Good to see yet more business leaders backing our policies which support investment and job creation: http://t.co/Ah9rqQ3RAC #businessletter
Cracking morning in Hendon with a great swathe of supporters out to launch the Tory campaign. Watch &amp; find out more: https://t.co/jgP0QO2lde
