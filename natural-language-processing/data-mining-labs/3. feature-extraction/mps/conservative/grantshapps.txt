Hard to disagree with the logic forcing 7 MPs to leave Corbyn's hard left Labour party, but having Chaired a national party I'm also aware that deep-rooted infrastructure is required - meaning it's institutionally very challenging to form an election-winning new party in the UK
This is great news for Welwyn Hatfield. Well done to @WelHatCouncil for securing this huge funding boost and look forward to seeing the impact it will have on town regeneration of both our town centres. https://t.co/7pSThBMwOP
Good to drop by @HatfieldCFS and to be quizzed by the Year 5 class on the ways Hatfield has changed over recent years. Great to hear of their pride in Hatfield being the birthplace of the jet engine! https://t.co/8wNoSPupSK https://t.co/SjVj7KwdxM
.@Theresa_May's #Brexit letter to Corbyn woos Labour MPs with Workers' Rights. Coalition worked hard to create a dynamic UK jobs market &amp; we enjoy half the unemployment rate of France by being a more attractive place to hire people. No point winning Labour MPs, by losing Tories!
If you have an hour a week then training to join the Compassionate Neighbours scheme is available from @IsabelHospice. Details on this poster. https://t.co/7R7vqdhcW8
Terrific scheme from @IsabelHospice in search of Compassionate Neighbours willing to give about an hour a week to offer friendship and a listening ear to anyone who is lonely or at risk of isolation. Details to follow in next tweet... https://t.co/dsSC1DDMe7
For goodness sake @donaldtusk. By saying "there is a special place in hell for those who promoted #Brexit without any plan for how to carry it [out]", you appear to be actively trying to wind everyone up &amp; even deliberately foil securing a #WithdrawalAgreement. IT'S ENOUGH!
Delighted to welcome so many Welwyn Hatfield residents on their visit to the Palace of Westminster last night. If you think #Brexit's causing chaos, some of the extraordinary history of this parliament genuinely puts today's machinations in perspective! https://t.co/k3o4o651bv
Promising meeting in Parliament with Welwyn Hatfield rail user groups with the Trains Minister to keep up the pressure on improving our services. Positive words of intention from the minister but now needs to be followed up with real action. https://t.co/efLC0f6GoT
Concerned about the possible closure of @Barclays in #Welwyn village and the impact this would have on the community. I’ll be meeting with senior members of the bank in the coming weeks to discuss. https://t.co/O65ppAyBrg
Whilst it's great to see my Remain &amp; Leave colleagues working closely to support #Brexit #MalthouseCompromise, they shouldn't lose track of the fact that if something like the #BradyAmendment fails this evening, then the #CooperAmendment risks us ending up with no Brexit at all!
Can't help feel, some of my #ERG colleagues might live to rue the day they refused to vote for the sensible Sir Graham Brady amendment, which helps us Leave. If parliament ends up 'taking back control', they may have just cut-off their noses to spite their faces! Strategic error?
Good news that commuters in Welwyn Hatfield will soon be using state-of-the-art new trains as soon as February. This is encouraging but much more still needs to be done by @GTRailUK to improve services. https://t.co/eH97GNhW3N
Sorry to read about this tragic case today https://t.co/MgyxKubSv2 Last year I released a report on how gov + internet industry can and must do more to make the internet a positive and safe environment. Pleased that @MattHancock is committed to doing so.  https://t.co/GL8hEJJmmQ
This evening, I've added my name to Sir Graham Brady's #Brexit amendment. This requires the NI backstop to be replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border; supports leaving the EU &amp; means parliament would support the #WithdrawalAgreement subject to this change.
Starting the day opening a breakfast with dozens of Welwyn Hatfield business leaders I've jointly invited with @DWP and @WelHatCouncil to our host @Hatfield_House to discuss employing people with disabilities through #disabilityconfident - Find out more https://t.co/TCZRy88XRK https://t.co/tyVBcsVhYW
Good luck to WGC man Peter Williams on the Cornish Costal Challenge raising money for the fantastic @IsabelHospice. 11 years on from a heart transplant, Pete knows all too well just how amazing charities like this are and would appreciate any support! https://t.co/iPbSIZo6Tb
After meeting with @GLL_UK bosses this evening, I’m cautiously optimistic that there’s a way to keep Gosling’s doors open for the community. Much work still to be done but I’m pleased that progress has been made. https://t.co/DEqHabDZVU
Congrats to everyone who ran the Essendon 10k for @IsabelHospice this morning. Great race, course and charity! https://t.co/MvKND40675
To be clear: I'm not calling for a General Election, nor do I think holding one is particularly desireable. However, I am pointing out that - given the parliamentary arithematic - an election is where we may end up if parliament remains gridlocked! https://t.co/cLmKks2WIy
Good broadband is vital for people to go about their daily lives. It’s time to stop treating broadband in new homes like it’s an optional extra! https://t.co/YVLk4jJ5nh
As per my Brexit speech in parliament here https://t.co/EIkQVFy1dZ I voted against the Withdrawal Agreement last night. But, I'll definitely be supporting the government in the Vote Of Confidence today.
I’ve now spoken to senior managers at @GLL_UK and have given them 7 days to present options to save Gosling Sports Hall. I look forward to meeting them and hearing what their solutions are. For more details:  https://t.co/clG9uzJVvK
I’m disappointed that no one with authority @GLL_UK will answer the community’s questions about @GoslingLeisure. I’ve demanded an urgent meeting this week or I’ll raise it @HouseofCommons + question their claim to be a ‘community-minded’ organisation https://t.co/B1aHMAyj3j
I'm giving Greenwich Leisure @GLL_UK until Monday to send someone with authority to Parliament to discuss their shock announcement to close the main Sports Hall at Gosling, or I'll be challenging their approach to local residents in the House of Commons @Better_UK https://t.co/dn2fQaa25v
I remain concerned about the ongoing Gosling Sports Hall situation. I’ve demanded a meeting with @GLL_UK tomorrow. Ahead of it, I’d be grateful to hear from any constituent with concerns grant@shapps.com. Plus, my latest on my call for a closure moratorium https://t.co/H8vk4eCqvk
Extremely concerned by the sports hall closure announcement at Gosling. Have demanded a meeting with the leisure organisation who run the facility and will report back   https://t.co/jHh3L9zzVk
In case you missed it, here’s a debate I secured to pressure the Transport Minister about the poor rail service delivered by @GNrailUK. In addition, I’m looking forward to a further catch up with their CEO later this month. https://t.co/Y8Z3Sk83Ri
Napoléon called us a nation of shopkeepers, but to maintain our high streets, radical action is required. My take on what needs to happen here: https://t.co/FoBD41RGmY
Wishing all my constituents a happy, peaceful and prosperous 2019, whatever the challenges we jointly tackle during the year ahead!
When @Jeremy_Hunt says we can learn from Singapore's economic success, some retort their model would be a disaster for the UK. But why? Singapore has 3rd highest per-capita GDP ($93,905) &amp; govt-run Universal Health (ranked 2nd worldwide). So why would their model destroy Britain?
Huge thank you to the wonderful #MixedGroup volunteers for joining us to serve meals to Welwyn Hatfield's otherwise alone pensioners this #XmasDay. None of which would happen without the incredible Seán Cox MBE, who has been organising for 45 years! https://t.co/lqXCNfT0wM
To the HUNDREDS of #WelHat residents who knitted THOUSANDS of wooly hats for Syrian children, I can report they've now been distributed to displaced children camps located in Bab Alhawa, Atmeh (Atimah) &amp; Qah (Kah), along the Syrian border with Turkey. MANY THANKS &amp; MERRY XMAS! https://t.co/YpoZsAoAmz
Secured a debate in Parliament this week to pressure the Transport Minister over various train related issues on @GNrailUK for Welwyn Hatfield commuters. Watch here &gt;&gt; https://t.co/wNsqKXWaoz
Great to meet @RoyalMail Hatfield team again to thank them for all their hard work not just during the busy Christmas period but also for the rest of the year and in all-weather. https://t.co/TXj97UhMWt
I’ve secured a debate in Parliament Tues about the shambolic rail services between Welwyn Hatfield &amp; London. I’ll be demanding answers about @GNRailUK performance, and making the case for @TfL to take over our line to #WGC. I'll also seek clarity on date for Oyster along our line
On calls for #PeoplesVote, I wonder if we might see a Winchester'97 situation. Tories narrowly lost that election by 2 votes, but claimed irregularity, got the election re-run, and promptly lost by nearly 21,556  votes! UPSHOT: People don't like being asked twice
Oyster pulling into Welwyn Hatfield! Lovely news that local rail travellers will finally be able to use Oyster and contactless payment cards for journeys to and from London.  https://t.co/iurdp3lDkr https://t.co/1MzefdFWgV
Regardless of where we'd each like Brexit to land, the reality is that planning for 29th March needs to be dramatically stepped up. PM should therefore Chair daily COBRA meetings to force Whitehall to urgently address every aspect of leaving EU in case no negotiated deal agreed!
Good to meet Hatfield based @AAATaxis_ and to hear their concerns about local issues that they’re currently facing. I’ve written to @WelHatCouncil on their behalf to see what can be done to make it a fair and level playing field for local taxis. https://t.co/dUDAylaUXc
With the big vote coming up on Tuesday, here is my speech in the Withdrawal Agreement Brexit debate. Partial video below &amp; full version at https://t.co/ahTRKNinMd whilst transcript can be found here: https://t.co/vUnukjysB5 https://t.co/JscPhwhwSr
Great to join Welwyn Hatfield posties first thing this morning to thank them for all their hard work delivering a big increase in parcels this Xmas. https://t.co/etnJ5HHetS
If you're a NON-season ticket commuter, who travelled 3+ times a week during the post-May timetable chaos, then the hard fought for 'Additional Industry Compensation Scheme' is now open for you here. Any problems claiming let me know at grant@shapps.com https://t.co/uoX14Z1mZJ
Worst-affected 2018 season ticket holders should receive a discount on 2019 season tickets, according to new report by MPs on this year's rail chaos https://t.co/U0UVcXJL64
CONFIRMED: After a very long campaign, Oyster is coming to Welwyn Garden City &amp; stations in-between including Hatfield, Welham Green, Brookmans Park during second half of next year, meaning contactless travel using Oyster, credit cards, plus Apple and Google pay to London https://t.co/3DzB0MiVmq
Congratulations to new Cllr Paul Smith for winning a closely contested by-election in Welwyn West on Thursday. Results: Con 960, LibDems 604, Lab 72. Paul will be a great representative for Welwyn.
BREAKING! A major Oyster card announcement due Friday will extend the excellent Oyster card system to #WGC. This is great news after a long campaign, but it won't prevent my battle to get our trains running properly too! https://t.co/PII34q5sCC
After my latest meeting with Govia’s boss, it’s clear that they’re trying to backtrack on increasing our #WelHat train services, despite previous assurances. I won’t let it rest here: https://t.co/19jDMD8o2Y
After a decade long campaign to widen the A1(M) to prevent traffic chaos to the Lister Hospital in Stevenage, this £170m scheme will finally remove the motorway jams through Welwyn. Thx for support from Paul Smith, County and Borough Cllrs too: https://t.co/KwzFAJ207g
Huge thank you to @coopukfood and their customers for raising thousands of pounds for two brilliant Welwyn Hatfield charities - @IsabelHospice and Warrenwood @RDAnational 🙂 - donation from £19m total raised #TheCoopWay https://t.co/Iouy8XLPYf
Met with @HighwaysEngland to discuss £170m Smart Motorway at #Welwyn - designed to remove traffic jams &amp; cut traffic though village. Work commences March  2020. My thanks to colleages at #WelHat Council &amp; Welwyn residents, including Paul Smith, who have assisted my campaign. https://t.co/PoKt2dPtEB
Given the APPALLING rail chaos we've experienced this year on @GNRailUK, I'm calling for a rail fare freeze this coming January  https://t.co/TJPJssHX3Z
Looking forward to new @GNRailUK boss Patrick Verwer coming back to see me today to discuss winning back our missing train services. This could be a meeting WITHOUT coffee unless there are some firm proposals for more Moorgate to #WGC trains!
To summarise the 585 page Brexit WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT (plus future partnership proposal): We gain back immigration control, but the price is agreeing to a permanent de facto Customs Union - which we may never unilaterally leave. Looks like a poor trade off. *Pours another coffee*
@Wynevs @harrywinmillion Ah, dishwasher broken. Part from Germany. Has required two weeks and counting. And that's before Brexit!
VERDICT: after 585 pages &amp; copious cups of coffee, this #WithdrawalAgreement looks v. problematic. £39bn to get out of Europe, but run by Europe. -To support this, requires 2 key changes. 1.Unilateral method of leaving backstop. 2.Future trade deal fleshed out beyond flimsy 7 pgs https://t.co/tKDHWjYb9H
I'll be discussing my latest reading of the 585 Withdrawal Agreement on @SkyNews after 3pm news https://t.co/jZlJtLHxiK
This is somewhat ominous: As I continue reading the 585 page Withdrawal Agreement it's becoming clear this hasn't actually been proof-read. Presumably the incomplete section pictured is in reference to a Joint Political Declaration? But who knows really... https://t.co/VBlud7Orbd
Today's 585 page #BrexitAgreement reading will perhaps reveal why even @DominicRaab who negotiated this has now said he cannot back the deal! https://t.co/YGe3r7BffA
This evening constituents rightly asking whether I'll vote for the new Brexit deal? ANSWER: I'll read all 500 pgs of the withdrawal agreement, alongside the UK/EU statement about our future relationship. Then, I'll base my vote on considered view of whether it stacks up to £39bn.
Pleased that Govia’s new CEO has promised to fix the unacceptable service on our trains. This cannot come soon enough for Welwyn Hatfield commuters. https://t.co/NF9DRDZyv3
Welwyn Hatfield Liberal Democrats apologise for sending election campaign letter to the late Cllr Mandy Perkins, asking for her vote  https://t.co/XkRFsprNHU https://t.co/iHszO7fwd8
@SoonBeHome Our own trade policy which, having carried out trade discussions for UK govt whilst in cabinet, I acknowledge is damaged by our current EU membership.
Many constituents getting in touch to ask how I'll vote on #Brexit deal. Until I actually see &amp; read every word (&amp; legal advice) it's impossible to judge. My key concern: We mustn't end up locked in a deal which neither provides the ADVANTAGES of Remain or the BENEFITS of Leave!
Met with new Govia CEO Patrick Verwer to demand urgent improvements on the train service which is currently untenable. I’ve demanded a follow up meeting on 19th November to see further proposals for improvement. Will keep you posted! https://t.co/ilZE9gpo6r
REMINDER: Tomorrow is the annual Xmas Market at the Riding School, @Hatfield_House. 10.30am to 4pm. Admission is £2 with accompanied children admitted free of charge. We donate half our proceeds to @IsabelHospice. Come along and pick up some great Christmas gifts! See you there https://t.co/0ibP34hTax
#Budget2018 My thoughts on NHS funding, High Street help and Universal Credit.   https://t.co/sOjkigi4B1
Just had new Chief Exec of @GTRailUK in to see me at parliament about the still hopeless @GNRailUK service. Promises a full  progress report on adding trains to Welwyn Hatfield when we next meet on Nov 19th. I will report back! https://t.co/RqASmYVgYI
A #Brexit deal would be good, but I'm not sure why @johnmcdonnellMP dislikes #Singapore model. Which part of having world's 3rd highest per-capita GDP ($93,905), govt-run Universal Health (ranked 2nd out of 166) or highest Trade to GDP ratio, does he think will ruin Britain?
Joined dozens of locals to help launch the #WGC @PoppyHerts appeal this morning in the @HowardCentre - lest we ever forget the sacrifices of those who enabled us to be free! @PoppyLegion https://t.co/CKtyIcLJV9
Great to have recently met the new Chair and Deputy of @ENHertsCCG, Dr’s Moodley and Shah. Encouraged that all Welwyn Hatfield residents can now receive Extended Access GP appointments at Spring House Surgery, from 8am-8pm weekdays, and on weekend mornings. #MakeHealthcareLocal https://t.co/4jZeuaLeay
Pleased to finally have some progress on this long running campaign to have a Smart Motorway on A1(M). This is vital to improve journey times to the Lister hospital. Seeking a meeting with @HighwaysEngland to make sure this doesn’t slip behind. https://t.co/ZD8ERLY85V
If no-deal #Brexit: flights grounded, City of London decimated, food &amp; medicine shortages, martians to land! Maybe. But daily coverage reminds me of #Y2K bug hysteria, where change to the new millennium was expected to wreak global havoc, but in reality had little affect at all! https://t.co/PZXKfQrcqe
#budget2018 is next Monday and I'm calling on @PhilipHammondUK at @hmtreasury to organise funding to extend @TfL #Oystercard travel to Welwyn Hatfield. After all the rail disruption we've experienced, this would be a good first step to getting a full #LondonOverground service
Fantastic start to this year’s Welhats campaign which supports the Hand in Hand with Syria charity. This year we’re aiming to beat last year’s tally of 3,000! https://t.co/3BnXE8P4Ke
Enjoyed taking part in the 10k event at Hatfield House supporting two fantastic local charities @isabelhospice and @HADability. Very proud to be patron of both. Well done to the race organisers! https://t.co/rxATAaNHQn
Pleased to see @parcelforce making a sizeable investment in Hatfield by opening their new South East Processing Centre here and creating over 60 new local jobs. Yet another business seeing the benefits of Hatfield! https://t.co/0rTPZcqEKG
I went to City Hall earlier to lobby the Deputy Mayor of London for Transport @Heidi_LDN and @TfL's Geoff Hobbs as part of my campaign to bring London Overground and Oyster out to #WelwynHatfield https://t.co/m2iGtv9XIZ
Congratulations to all 406 runners who completed the @Hatfield_House 10k &amp; half marathon on behalf of @IsabelHospice &amp; @HADability this morning https://t.co/agEyGSZMBE
Looking forward to joining hundreds of others in the rain ☔ at @Hatfield_House for a charity race this morning for both @IsabelHospice and @HADability  https://t.co/SEFyKYt8DQ
I'm a #Brexit moderate who voted #Remain, but since we're going to #Leave we must make it work for us. I can't therefore see that either parliament or I would vote for Britain to be locked into a permanent open-ended customs union arrangement! https://t.co/8vY3g4SOH0
Still a few places left if anyone wants to join me in running the Hatfield House 10k on Sunday in aid of @IsabelHospice and @HADability. You can sign up here: https://t.co/J7OxZgpyNN Spectators also welcome to come and enjoy the beautiful Hatfield Park estate.
Congratulations to @WelHatCouncil on winning @Herts_BFAwards for these new housing developments. Very poignant coming so soon after the sad death of Cllr Mandy Perkins who was always so passionate about affordable housing and delivering as many as possible for local people. https://t.co/t9ORqUWa0K
DATE FOR YOUR DIARY: The Xmas Market run by local conservatives returns on 3rd November at Hatfield House. Not only a great opportunity to grab a bargain &amp; get ahead on your Xmas shopping but we also donate half our proceeds to the fantastic @IsabelHospice https://t.co/8iD6VrRjSJ
Strongly welcome @railandroad rail regulator confirming they've opened an investigation into @GNRailUK to determine whether they breached their operating licence over failure to provide passenger information during the timetable fiasco https://t.co/7ggk9TvcA8 #KickThemOut
Great to see the Coronation Fountain in WGC going pink once again for whole of October to mark Breast Cancer Awareness month. Thanks to @WelHatCouncil and locally based @Rocheuk for highlighting the importance of confronting this awful disease https://t.co/9ATGlYhl1m
Well constructed, written &amp; delivered @theresa_may speech today. Last yr was leadership change window, but now PM needs to complete #Brexit deal. Btw, anyone who doubts 'end to austerity' pledge, should note Council House build borrowing cap removal could well increase deficit
Last chance to get tickets for @HertsVisionLoss curry night on 11th October and help support people with severe and permanent sight loss in Hertfordshire. Please see here for more details: https://t.co/xxLA3phYwH
.@_safwaan_ @ReneTrevor @DavidLammy I've been emailing + trying to get in touch, having discussed your case with another MP a couple of weeks ago. Number we have for you is out of date. Please contact grant@shapps.com. Thx
.@ReneTrevor we have been trying to reach you via email without response. Could you call my office or email me direct grant@shapps.com
Compassionate, inclusive and ultimately incredibly brave too. For sheer dedication to public service, no one outshone Councillor Mandy Perkins. Our thoughts and prayers are with her husband David. Welwyn Hatfield has lost a great community champion, and we are all devastated. https://t.co/XaDkKpS0Lb
Today @GNRailUK have been in touch to say that they're now testing the new 717 Class train from #Moorgate to #WGC with passengers on board. Putting aside the obvious response about their (in)ability to run anything on time, I hope these trains will improve their appalling service https://t.co/iJAKRDQye7
Voted REMAIN as I recognised Leaving EU would be a hassle. But, I'm a democrat &amp; the LEAVE win was clear. However, Chequers must now avoid delivering the worst of both worlds - NEITHER maintaining the benefits of trade inside EU, nor the genuine advantages of flexibility outside!
Charity campaign Welhats that provides warm clothing to displaced people in Syria with @hihfad is back for its 6th year. Let’s make break last year’s tally of 3,000 items! For all knitters who want to get involved please see here for details: https://t.co/Ot6TmJ9uXw
About to discuss @GNRailUK appalling rail service on @BBC3CR https://t.co/kI4W3z5Zme? and how to get money back from them.
Thx to my constituent who's contacted me with a copy of @GNRailUK email confirming £261.60 fare compensation for the appalling post-May timetable debacle. A reminder to check your eligibility here https://t.co/uoX14Z1mZJ - and part-time commuter (3days+) scheme I won opening soon
Absolutely claim for the taxi fare. They will need to pay out if they didn't run a service! https://t.co/qvW6uizaDB
Great charity @HertsVisionLoss is hosting a curry night on 11th October at the Don in WGC to raise money to support people with severe and permanent sight loss. If you’d like to find out more or to contribute please do get in touch here: https://t.co/9bVWaZ1pjs
The defiant response by @theresa_may to the #SalzburgSummit 'disaster' reminds me of the popularity of @David_Cameron's unplanned Dec 2011 EU Treaty veto. Both found that the public applauds a PM who stands up for the United Kingdom's interests.
Out knocking on doors in #WGC this morning and it's clear from conversations that the #EU has done itself no favours at #SalzburgSummit18. People want a deal, but not if it means dividing the UK down the Irish sea or handing over £39bn for nowt in return! https://t.co/ivO8Z27LXZ
Met to discuss a fantastic initiative by local teachers to promote healthy cooking in schools. They've already had success elsewhere - now we're working to bring their excellent programme to Welwyn Hatfield schools. See https://t.co/cXzt3hwT2T https://t.co/fXEDaBF0vY
I notice the blunt message for Theresa May in Salzburg in which Council President @donaldtusk says her Brexit plan won't work for EU. Well, I'm no Brexiteer (in fact I voted Remain), but we may fast be approaching a situation where our handing over £39bn won't work for us either!
Giving blood is quick, easy and it might save someone’s life. If you’d like to donate, an NHS Blood and Transplant team is visiting Woodhall Community Centre in WGC tomorrow! For more details and how to make an appointment please visit: https://t.co/mvxcZ5PSDW
I’m pleased to see these plans have been suspended. The possibility of losing any of our fire cover is never acceptable. I look forward to working with @HertsPCC to ensure our emergency services have everything they need to work seamlessly together. https://t.co/tXXEB9C4lM

Air Passenger Duty already rakes in millions, so the last thing holidaying families want now is a new Border Tax when they fly &gt;&gt; https://t.co/ytWt7lF7f0
For anyone waiting on the #GTR @GNRailUK compensation scheme (i.e. one month's free travel), this very brief info video describes what should happen next. Worth a watch to see which category you're in as a commuter  https://t.co/tTvv5mGWxM
I've compiled this document outlining missing/slower trains TO/FROM #WelwynHatfield since May timetable. I'm asking residents to help check the document before I make representations to rail bosses &amp; ministers. Pls read &amp; email me grant@shapps.com and RT https://t.co/kV0U0sSrVK
After months of rail chaos, I’m pleased that my calls for an Additional Compensation package for non-season ticket holders have finally be heard. Part-time commuters may not travel every day, but they deserve the same compensation. More details here: https://t.co/xpe3CSWoch
Even now these @GNRailUK clowns can't run their trains on time. It's truly pathetic. Working to have them replaced by @TfL London Overground. https://t.co/58yPwOA084
Since 2010, the number of workless households has fallen 964,000. With an average of 1,000 people per (working) day entering the workforce. We're seeing record levels of Welwyn Hatfield employment and record UK employment levels since the 1970s.
Very encouraging to see new figures showing the number of children in workless households is at a record low. Compared to 2010, there are 637,000 fewer children living in a workless household – and 300,000 fewer children living in absolute poverty.
Details of the new part-time rail commuter Additional Compensation Scheme I fought for are now available right here  https://t.co/NQWwxMivqP and you CAN claim even if you already used Delay Repay on some of your journeys! @GNRailUK
You might imagine that if global poverty halved in just 20 years, that would definitely be front page news! Yet I don't recall ever seeing this incredibly story lead the news, even though Britain has played a very major part in helping it happen. https://t.co/N3Vh4ncjcz
Good luck to Rev’d Munchin @wsm_church as he sets out to cycle to Rome on Sunday. To cycle 1,700 miles in aid of Herts Welcomes Syrian Families is a typically selfless act by David. Enjoy the ride! For more details and how to support please see here: https://t.co/B4VNAHcT3p
I fought a long, very hard battle to get compensation for commuters who travel part-time (3 days+ per week), but don't necessarily have a season ticket, yet were equally put out by the recent rail chaos. Delighted to say this scheme is due to be announced by @GNRailUK today!
I'm interesting in getting the rail service sorted out, not stupid idiology, so I also wrote to the Deputy Mayor for Transport, Heidi Alexander &amp; received this very constructive letter back. I will work closely to get @TfL running more trains &amp; better integrated service w/ Oyster https://t.co/3RLKIATKDP
Given unacceptable rail chaos, I wrote to MPs from Moorgate to WGC asking them to support @TfL takeover. Got great response. But a 'No' from @jeremycorbyn who instead briefed papers that a Tory wanted to nationalise rail, oblivious to the fact London Overground is privately run!
As a supporter of the Armed Forces Covenant I’m delighted to hear about the Armed Forces &amp; Veterans Breakfast Clubs’ continuing success. Huge thanks to Hatfield resident @laineyann50 for her hard work in making this possible. For your nearest club see here:https://t.co/s5RpZBOWMa
https://t.co/qees4wIZex Great to see so many enjoying The Mixed Group’s latest event.  Well done to all those who continue to make this such a fantastic charity. If you’d like to donate or get involved visit: https://t.co/J8anPwoNuO Looking forward to the cycle ride in Sept!
Good luck to Men’s Voices United – a new choir based in WGC raising money for mental health charities. If you’d like to take part, donate or get tickets for their Gala concert at Hatfield House on World Mental Health Day - 10th October – please see here: https://t.co/gWyamNZpHe
Govia's results released for period 30th July to 12th August and includes this note, "Problems with driver availability led to 805 minutes of delays &amp; 27 cancellations on the Great Northern network." Note to @GNRailUK bosses - You're running a railway. This will require drivers!
@shxlini ? I've done little else but talk up about this issue. Please check my very very many posts!
Whilst @HertsPCC assures me that there are no such plans to close fire stations, I am still deeply concerned about this and am not prepared to put my name to any proposal that even has the smallest possible chance of losing any of our fire cover. https://t.co/3LQlBxpsCB
5yrs ago this month a recalled parliament failed to back action after Assad gassed his own people; leading to a cascade of global events that has caused untold human misery. Writing in @thetimes @AnthonySeldon explains how the  catastrophy unfolded https://t.co/xSfv1TBHU5
Following up on my previous tweet containing the train performance graphs, here is the accompanying commentary from the research I commissioned through the House of Commons Library https://t.co/EY9m46VwPt
Asked House of Commons Library to analyse @GNRailUK performance since May &amp; then since the 15th July update. Though service did stabilise post 15th July, left with HUGE gaps, plus this week the service has been extremely poor once again. I want @transportgovuk to strip franchise! https://t.co/rN7unrF4uJ
Two trains in a row to Moorgate cancelled this a.m. First due to shortage of crew, second arrived, but driver took it out of service saying he was going back to depot instead. Completely unbeknown to the staff at the station! Come on @transportgovuk strip the @GNRailUK franchise!
Organ donation saves lives, so I strongly welcome a change in English law that will place everyone on the Organ register - enabling people to opt-out rather than in - so that people waiting for a life-saving transplant can live; thereby saving hundreds of lives each year.
@Nh1973Neil @realDonaldTrump Yes it's been absolutely appalling and completely unacceptable. I use the trains most days (when you can get them). I've been posting about the trains for weeks and this is where we're at https://t.co/rhPe2Ho4OO - also feel free to drop me email grant@shapps.com
@timwhale Or maybe don't believe everything you read on a blog.
Far be it from me to defend @realDonaldTrump who shoots from the hip, but bet a lot of Brits are also unaware about the difference between Great Britain and the United Kingdom. And whilst we're at it; outsiders are bemused by the UK being a nation, yet also made up of 4 nations!
Really great to see this big investment in south Hatfield move forward. Worth responding to the consultation online or in person during the dates listed   https://t.co/toV5TFMKh5
Good luck to constituent @TomBakhurst in his efforts to raise money for Shitima School in Zambia which provides housing and education to former street kids who would otherwise be living in terrible poverty. If anyone would like to contribute, please visit: https://t.co/IOAjXXueNW
Britain's railways are the envy of Europe, says train boss, as he is accused of 'living on another planet' https://t.co/gHyW2X19Z7
Presumably these people calling for a 2nd EU Referendum will just call for a 3rd, if we fail to vote the right way again. What utter nonsense! We've had a referendum and, even though I was on the losing side, I recognise our job is to deliver the result not ask the question again
Delighted to unveil a portrait at @MonksWalkSch of deputy head Noel Kelly who is retiring after 42 years. Thanks to Noel for his outstanding service to our community and the lasting impact he’s had on thousands of children in WGC over the years. Have a great retirement! https://t.co/GGFTaboTTV

Not exactly a page turner, but Sunday was sunny so spent 5.5 hours outdoors reading Brexit White Paper cover-to-cover; making margin notes. CONCLUSIONS: 1. No way Cabinet had time to read in full prior to Chequers. 2. Will live with it as end point, but not if ripped apart by EU.
171 MPs &amp; Lords are deeply concerned by planning app to destroy #Fairoaks Airport. UK is running out of airfields, but should be investing in high-tech #STEM jobs instead.

Good news that new B197 study reflects locals’ views that the current speed limit is a genuine safety risk particularly with two primary schools nearby and that solutions are needed. https://t.co/HgMf1sBGZI
To commuters paying MORE than they would on the train because of late/cancelled trains - e.g. got a taxi, booked a hotel, etc -  you can reclaim ‘additional costs’ on your delay repay form @GNRailUK. It’s not obvious, but worked with constituents who've successfully rec'd claims.
Great to see sunny WGC celebrating #NHS70. When I had cancer years back the health service saved my life, so I’m pleased we’re investing more in our great NHS than ever before. If you haven’t joined my #MakeHealthcareLocal campaign please sign up: https://t.co/YXtMGcNrPN https://t.co/HOcWkSLs72
#GTR have actually lost the plot. I recently fought case of constituent being prosecuted for inadvertently sitting in wrong carriage. Imagine if we all prosecuted Govia each time they inconvenienced us by getting us to work late &amp; cancelling trains! https://t.co/WJnvezgW6j
Brexit was never going to be easy &amp; with hindsight could have been handled differently. BUT the time for leadership change passed last autumn &amp; we can't have a 3mth contest now - alongside EU negotiations up to Oct summit. So let's knuckle down, back the plan &amp; get the job done!
Hardly inspires confidence that @GNRailUK will have a reliable timetable running by 15th July. This Sunday! https://t.co/EYFGiXEjvF
Had an extremely detailed briefing tonight in Downing Street about the Chequers Brexit position. SHORT SUMMARY: Leaving EU is complex, but here's a possible way forward. LONG SUMMARY: I'll reflect &amp; set out more detailed thoughts tomorrow.
Screen grab earlier today at Welwyn Garden City. Simply unbelievable that 8 weeks after that disastrous Govia Thameslink Timetable shakeup, this is the chaos still being wrought on commuters. And one week today is the 15th July DEADLINE for trains to run on time! Confident? https://t.co/0rhAnYVACj
With regard to Brexit: I've always believed we must ensure we don't end with neither the ADVANTAGES of staying NOR the BENEFITS of leaving! So I'll be discussing the Cabinet agreement in Downing Street later today &amp; will be sure to let my constituents know my view.
@BritishRedCross is looking for residents in Welwyn Hatfield to become community reserve volunteers in times of need. No specialist skills required. For more info please see https://t.co/ueV0eEoYMd or get in touch with them: reserves@redcross.org.uk https://t.co/Cjgjtbpk8i
HEADS UP for suffering @GNRailUK commuters. Compensation scheme (1 month free travel) being announced today. Transport Sec just called me to say details of part-time commuters (i.e. 3 days a week+) are not announced today, but WILL still happen! Details being worked on.
Today's @GNRailUK ticket machine trick. Let's see if we have any better luck with trains themselves! https://t.co/iAnOlb7ixL
Health chiefs reveal blood testing plan to cut waiting times at QE2 &gt;&gt; https://t.co/oOE1aaEobl Frankly, not before time, and a specific ask of my #MakeHealthcareLocal campaign.
This might be useful for other @GNRailUK victims, where ticket machines are broken. "Grant, we understand not all compensation claims are simple &amp; include a text box on our online claim form to allow for extra details. Katherine Cox, Stakeholder Mgr. Govia Thameslink"
It's week 7. It's truly pathetic &amp; actually positively dangerous on many crowded platforms! These @GNRailUK clowns couldn't run a bath, let alone a railway. Hope @transportgovuk gearing up alternate operation when they inevitably have to strip this franchise post 15th July. https://t.co/8VgqIKAhw9
@huwjpthomas it wasn't a comment on the arguments, just on the subjects raised. Not are how personal interest relevant ref this post though?
@WGCitizens @GNRailUK Please drop me an email at grant@shapps.com with the full details. Thanks
Trains (or rather lack of), Brexit (for &amp; against), plus parking &amp; my #MakeHealthcareLocal campaign.  All subjects on the doorstep this weekend in the Hollybush area of Welwyn Garden City. Great to knock on doors when there's no election, just to help people out. Thx action team! https://t.co/NddqECoasH

Latest update on Govia train chaos including my meeting with Transport Secretary here: https://t.co/rhPe2Ho4OO
Week 6 of @GNRailUK chaos &amp; absolutely NO improvement! Here's #WelwynGardenCity to #London THIS MORNING! I've sent @transportgovuk Secretary of State this image just now for his meet with @TLRailUK later today. I will meet after that. People should be able to get to work &amp; back! https://t.co/d2BT6DtYsX
The train service to Welwyn Hatfield is unacceptable. It’s time we get the service that local residents deserve that’s why I’m calling on Ministers to make Welwyn Hatfield a London Overground line. https://t.co/LA6cVx3WE1
@jmcomms @owenhb17 @GNRailUK @TfL Actually Welham Green and Brookmans Park are the only two stations on the Moorgate line that saw a reduced service in the new timetable (when it actually gets up and running). I want to see those services brought back, and @TfL are proposing exactly that!
@owenhb17 @GNRailUK @TfL Oh, just spotted. That's TfL writing, not me. They've probably written that because it's a station I use a lot, but I use them all depending on what I've been doing that day and this is the line to WGC
@owenhb17 @GNRailUK @TfL Where am I specifying Brookmans Park? This is about Hatfield, WGC, Welham Green, etc.
So now there's a new @GNRailUK trick. With their ticket machines not working PLUS trains cancelled and delayed. It's now impossible to claim a refund and a single is only 10p cheaper than return. UPSHOT: Now you don't get the service AND you can't reclaim! @transportgovuk https://t.co/erEF58SWmn
UK wouldn't deliberately limit SeaPorts &amp; expect to continue trading successfully post-Brexit, so why do we imagine we can cope without sufficient AirPort capacity? @BIG_MPs strongly welcomes today's #HeathrowExpansion debate. Time to vote for the UK's future prosperity!
Right. This is the service I want to deliver to Welwyn Hatfield. Let's boot out @GNRailUK and bring in @TfL to run our line. Here's what's on offer. Please let me know your thoughts? https://t.co/Dgpx4sta52

Network Rail's Sir Peter Hendry issues apology for Welwyn Hatfield train service | Hertfordshire traffic and motoring news - Welwyn Hatfield Times https://t.co/7dv5ASdGz7
Following the outrageous "passenger delay experience is merely anecdotal" comment by @NetworkRail's Chief Exec, the Chair got in touch with this fulsome apology to my constituents. I will work with him to re-establish timetable that doesn't slash services to Welwyn Hatfield. https://t.co/3skKNCXDMY
The @GNRailUK mayhem continues, but now these clowns pretend to run phantom trains! Each of these trains was in fact cancelled, whilst their @TLRailUK website claims they're all running. All merely anecdote according to the @NetworkRail Chief Exec, whose about to accept his CBE! https://t.co/SD2KStxS4D
Like many others, the NHS saved my life and so I strongly welcome plans to invest nearly £400m more a week in the NHS in real terms; meaning an extra £20bn a yr by 2023-24. A boost for my #MakeHealthcareLocal campaign I hope. https://t.co/YXtMGcNrPN
I wish EVERY commuter, struggling to get to work and home, could have been in this extraordinary meeting in my office last week: Bungling train boss Mark Carne shrugs off commuter misery as ‘trivial’ and claims no one pays ‘full cost’ for their train https://t.co/HoKGSetqIo
Always great to drop by and visit @BHGSchool and on this occasion to speak to their Sixth Form during their Life Skills lesson. Enjoyed the lively debate. https://t.co/TX8nRfsaYp
Parliament is ALWAYS sovereign, meaning that it can ALWAYS overturn anything previously decided, which is why - even as a Remain voter - I urge my more radical Remain colleagues NOT to tie the PM's negotiating hand in Brussels. Their amendment significantly weakens UK position!
[2 of 2] The upshot: The CBE was "not my fault". And nor, apparently, is any of the rail chaos! My view: When things go wrong in public life it's right for people to offer to take some responsibility. I hope the @CommonsTrans takes this up fully during their investigation.
[1 of 2] @networkrail boss Mark Carne came to see me. He suggested my @GNRailUK experience was 'anecdotal' compared to impressive infrastructure achievements of his tenure. I said declining his CBE for now would send better message to hundreds-of-thousands of suffering commuters
Outgoing @networkrail boss Mark Carne coming in to see me at parliament this afternoon. When @GNRailUK bosses came in they mentioned I was the angriest MP they'd met over rail chaos. Given my journey's these past few weeks, I hope Mark Carne CBE is feeling brave today!
Totally OUTRAGEOUS that passengers may have refunds rejected by @GNRailUK if they've claimed too many times (given the massive level of disruption). If you live in Welwyn Hatfield &amp; you've experienced this issue, please contact me https://t.co/D4WqdOymcG
@MargolisDeborah likewise 😀

Good @JulianSmithUK bringing #Brexit back to Commons next Tue for marathon 12hr debate on 15 Lords amendments. As a Remain voter I hope MPs recall that our constituents voted to Leave &amp; that we have already debated every single issue. In other words... let's get on with it folks!
I'll be discussing the appalling @GNRailUK situation on BBC London in a few minutes, as well as that meeting I held with the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling earlier this afternoon asking him to strip the franchise.
Met Transport Sec &amp; spelt out how devastating this disruption is for my constituents. Grayling will introduce passenger compensation scheme, official inquiry &amp; threat to remove franchise. But even if this timetable ran on time, it's bad news for Welwyn Hatfield. I'm meeting TfL. https://t.co/h9hpaaP5yw
Was all going so well with my quest to meet the Transport Sec to discuss the trains. BUT... on reaching Finsbury Pk we've hit long delay. Turns out this @GNRailUK train awaits another driver who - you guessed it - is delayed on a late running train. You couldn't make it up! #Fail
Will my @GNRailUK train to get me to a meeting with the Transport Secretary to complain about the cancelled and late trains get me there on time? https://t.co/mvSNLA8tVZ
Good on @sajidjavid querying students being included in immigration figures. Obviously should be excluded... (a) Including sends wrong signal about desire to 'export' UK education (b) Britain should want brightest &amp; best to stay (c) Most students leave after their courses anyway!

Queues for blood tests! Exactly what we warned @enherts about as they kept sending healthcare resources to Stevenage. Sign our petition at https://t.co/YXtMGcNrPN and make health bosses respond to Welwyn Hatfield health needs.  https://t.co/nQQbedWDC7 #MaleHealthcareLocal
Further to raising constituents’ concerns about queues for blood tests at New QE2, I’ve received this reply from @enherts. Not good enough. For far too long health services have been stripped out of Welwyn Hatfield. We need to #MakeHealthcareLocal https://t.co/nTcoxflIaj https://t.co/oZzH68q4RG
CONFIRMED: Commercial jet MH17 was shot down by Western Russian missile. THE BACKSTORY: An emboldened Putin invaded Ukraine after West failed to act in 2013. More proof @theresa_may was RIGHT to strike Putin-backed Assad after chemical weapon use last mth https://t.co/19FoeZOj9s
[4 of 4]: And (though I know this sounds like an outlandish idea to @GNRailUK) we actually want the blinking trains on their timetable to run at the advertised times! Too much to ask? They have until the end of this year. I will work to try to get this timetable improved!
[3 of 4]: The timetable will be REVIEWED this Dec and there are two changes I want to see. (i) We want the faster WGC to London journey-time back. (ii) We want at least 3 daytime trains an hour back from all Welwyn Hatfield stations.
[2 of 4]: Be warned! Disruption is apparently going to continue for another 6 to 8 wks whilst this new timetable beds in. My response to that is virtually unprintable, but I’m passing on the info as I promised. However, there is slightly more promising news… [see 3 of 4].
[1 of 4]: So, my (no coffee) summoning of @GNRailUK top execs was pretty fiery. I laid it on the line telling them that their service was beyond a disgrace &amp; that their new timetable is simply unacceptable to me and my Welwyn Hatfield constituents. https://t.co/eukRLGWXpe
Due to meet with Govia @GNRailUK at 14.15 this afternoon. And guess what based on the time of this tweet? You got it, they're late! This is going to be a meeting without coffee!
Together with @BIG_MPs I very strongly welcome @PhilipHammondUK bold announcement of full-fibre broadband to homes across the UK. I live in an area where full fibre 330mbps broadband is installed. Rolling this out nationwide will provide a massive boost for families &amp; businesses.

Looking forward to this useless excuse of a rail operator @GNRailUK losing their franchise in 2021, because from today they're worsening services through Welwyn Hatfield. But at least the franchise system does mean that they can &amp; will be booted out! https://t.co/ANhNIspqUM

Just a week after the @HouseofCommons voted for press freedom, the @UKHouseofLords has voted to restrict it. Now the Commons will have to overturn the Lords yet again. I know we might not always like what they write, but surely a free press is one of the foundations of democracy!

Big welcome for PM's appointment of @sajidjavid to @ukhomeoffice. A great move.
Sorry to see @AmberRuddHR resign. An honourable HomeSec throughout. I would think @sajidjavid would make a first class replacement &amp; would give UK first BAME @ukhomeoffice Secretary of State too.
On @AmberRuddHR, seems to me everyone should stay focussed on resolving #WindrushGeneration rather than playing #WhoSawWhichMemoWhen game. As minister, you don't see every piece of paper &amp; clear HomSec thought correct info given. It wasn't. She's corrected &amp; apologised. Move on!

In addition to the proposed ban on plastic straws, I’m proud that this government is leading the way on tackling plastic waste by banning microbeads, the 5p plastic bag charge and the pledge to introduce a deposit on single use drinks containers. A cleaner and greener Britain!
I’m pleased that the government is launching a consultation on banning plastic straws. Plastic waste is one of the greatest environmental challenges &amp; ridding the UK of the 8.5billion straws thrown away each year would be an astounding achievement. Great work! @michaelgove
@BHGSAlumna Yes please do drop me an email at grant@shapps.com to discuss further! Best, Grant.

After UK parliament failed to act against #Syrian chemical attack in 2013, I listened in on Cameron/Putin phone call as Russian President mockingly thanked Cameron &amp; UK parliament for NOT responding. It was clear Putin perceived West's response as weak, indecisive &amp; a green light
Chemical weapon use is abhorrent &amp; internationally banned. Parliament's failure to respond in 2013 was taken by Assad &amp; Putin as  green light to continue gassing #Syrians. I therefore strongly support UK, US &amp; French action. The message is clear, stop use of chemical weapons now!
Congratulations to Joe Heeney on his Royal Wedding invitation - a fitting reward to celebrate @ResolveCharity 10th birthday! Resolve is a fantastic local charity which does so much to help those who suffer from addiction and I’m proud to be their patron https://t.co/3HHZgLN1qQ
In Aug'13 MPs FAILED to act after Assad chemical genocide. Putin pledged agreement to destroy #Syria chemical weapons, but it's been open-season: MH17 downed; Ukraine annexed; elections meddled; Skripal poisoned; PLUS 58 separate Syrian chemical attacks. Wake up world!
Pleased that areas in Hatfield are to benefit from better internet. In today’s age it’s vital that local residents have the best internet available.  I will keep working with @OpenreachHelp to ensure they continue improving internet across Welwyn Hatfield. https://t.co/69LB3StVNV

@NickyKuklys @HatfieldSocial @CarersinHerts @Hertsviewpoint @ResolveCharity @HertsSUShelby @hertssu @sportinherts @SLL_Leisure @HPFT_Wellbeing @HPFT_NHS Hi Nicky thanks for the invite, would love to attend but sadly already committed to another event in Hatfield! All the best though, and hope you raise lots of money for a fantastic cause!
Following our success reopening the @PostOffice in #WelwynGardenCity, I was thrilled to cut the ribbon at the new branch in #BrookmansPark! This one will be open an extra six hours a week, great news for the many residents who use the services regularly. https://t.co/fT5FbMboxg https://t.co/oxmNZ0w1EO
Great to have so many people join my MP’s Action Team in #Haldens this morning, campaigning for our fantastic candidate Drew Richardson in the upcoming #WelwynHatfield borough elections! @WelHatTory https://t.co/axQbhjqCPH
Great news that 30,000 more people in #WelwynHatfield are now saving for their retirement, thanks to changes to workplace pensions. Auto-enrolment is now the ‘new normal’ for businesses across the UK. https://t.co/tkdlESVMR9 @TPRgovuk
@peterzjackson Actually I don’t have private health insurance and never have! Completely agree that this is unacceptable. Please do sign my petition to #MakeHealthcareLocal and bring NHS services back to Welwyn Hatfield at https://t.co/nTcoxflIaj! Would be great to have your support
Passionately support this @DailyMirror campaign. It's time to switch to an #organdonation opt-out system and start saving lives! https://t.co/xF8IR1aKHL
@Peter_PPC Hi Peter please can you drop me an email about this at grant@shapps.com with all the details so I can investigate? Thanks, Grant.
Huge step forward for regeneration of #Hatfield Town Centre, with @WelHatCouncil submitting £1.2m plans to transform White Lion Square. I will be talking to colleagues about how we can commemorate Mayor @LynneSparks, who worked so hard to achieve this. https://t.co/zDtX80MbdL
My tribute to a true champion for #WelwynHatfield, Cllr @LynneSparks: https://t.co/uWBiOQT2DH

Deeply saddened by the death of #WelwynHatfield Mayor Cllr @LynneSparks. A fantastic local councillor, who served twice as the borough's mayor, and a tireless campaigner for many local charities. My thoughts are with Ian and the whole family. https://t.co/rtzqJ5ell1
It's great news that @HighwaysEngland are taking measures to improve Junction 2 of the A1(M). I wrote to them in January, and concrete blocks were installed last week to prevent littering. Astonishingly, 29 bags of litter have been collected! https://t.co/pTM6tAuBxd

Listen to my interview on @BBC3CR talking about the launch of a major campaign to #MakeHealthcareLocal! With #WelwynHatfield's population continuing to grow, we want NHS services brought back to our borough and made more accessible for everyone. https://t.co/Gro7HgjtTn
As this BBC News article shows, it was Labour who made the decision to move NHS services away from #WelwynHatfield. That's why I've launched my #MakeHealthcareLocal campagin. Sign the petition today at https://t.co/nTcoxflIaj!   https://t.co/WAQaiT7AEU
PLEASE RT: I’ve launched a major new campaign to #MakeHealthcareLocal, calling on @enherts to reverse the drift of NHS services away from #WelwynHatfield. As our population increases, we need MORE local health services, not less. Sign the petition here: https://t.co/nTcoxflIaj

As we celebrate #100years since women got the right to vote, there’s still much more to do. I want to see more women standing for public office. Local groups in #WelwynHatfield can apply for funding to help run events and increase engagement here: https://t.co/sVOH7hrOrB
@Hypahippy Hi Dave can you drop me an email at grant@shapps.com with all the details. Unfortunately Twitter is not a good forum for confidential casework. Look forward to receiving your email.
I echo call from @NHSBT for more blood donations in #WelwynHatfield. The NHS needs 200,000 new blood donors every year to maintain supplies. Find out more about giving blood at https://t.co/mvxcZ5PSDW or on the @GiveBloodNHS app. https://t.co/lWJw0LUHjA
Really productive meeting with the @hertssu Elected Officers, discussing lots of important issues for students locally and nationally. Great to meet such an informed and engaged team, looking forward to making this an annual event! https://t.co/GbAkF1bw2y
Pleasure to officially open Oakview Lodge Care Home in #WelwynGardenCity, with space for 64 residents and a range of facilities including fully functioning pub! With #dementia on the rise, so important we have care homes providing the support we need. https://t.co/IDBh7BFyqC https://t.co/pX7PuY4WHk
Astounded that 6/10 #broadband customers endured slow speeds or faulty connections last year. Fully support @CitizensAdvice call for independent telecoms consumer advocate. Needs to be addressed in the forthcoming Government Consumer Green Paper. https://t.co/izjhPOOi36
Thanks very much to everyone who helped out with the large MPs Action Team this morning in Welham Green. Great to chat to so many local residents today. https://t.co/GWYiu30Aaj
Great visit to The Gate House in WGC town centre, to see development of a new Travelodge hotel and office space. Yet another boost for local jobs and growth. Projects like these are showing once again that #WelwynHatfield remains a great place to do business. #TechGardenCity https://t.co/jHHPh4g5Y4
I’ve signed @HolocaustUK Book of Commitment to support #HolocaustMemorialDay and reflect on the tragic events of the Holocaust. I encourage everyone in #WelwynHatfield to support this important day. https://t.co/NId5ASf35i https://t.co/mi8Wy6ex76
Had great fun participating in the 5K Run Essendon event. Over £10,000 was raised for local charity @IsabelHospice which provides such a valuable service in #WelwynHatfield. A fantastic amount of money raised so well done to everyone who took part, especially as it was snowing! https://t.co/dkU9xkmM7m
Fascinating visit to @heartsmilkbank in #WelwynGardenCity to see vital work they do providing donor human milk to premature, sick and vulnerable infants on road to recovery. Astonishingly only 1% of people know about services milk banks provide! https://t.co/7wxBr2XZq1 https://t.co/C4N8CSbcHE

Fantastic news from @marksandspencer that they are creating 500 new jobs in #WelwynHatfield by opening a distribution centre in #WelhamGreen next year. Huge investment in our borough, proving that we remain an attractive place for businesses and families. https://t.co/Kum6p7eL75
Proud to support dementia friendly community cafe, run by @HISCWelwynGC for local people affected by memory loss, Alzheimer’s and other types of #dementia.

Great to visit Welwyn St Mary's Primary School to answer Qs from the School Council! Some fantastic questions about my job as MP for #WelwynHatfield.

Congrats to local constituent Mark Lampert who, along with others, has successfully fought to bring the Pearl statue back to #Hatfield town centre. White Lion Square is improving thanks to £1.2m investment from @WelHatCouncil but much more to do. https://t.co/ycCWy1O3k7
ICYMI: I was on @BBCWorldatOne earlier this week with @SirBobKerslake and @pollyn1 to talk about #housing crisis. Without bold, creative and ambitious housebuilding programme, we won't be able to tackle pressures of getting on housing ladder. Listen here: https://t.co/1Tlfz3PsnX
@egubby Hi Emily please could you email me about this at grant@shapps.com so I can investigate?
.@ResolveCharity do fantastic work in #WelwynHatfield helping people with drug and alcohol problems https://t.co/vOVttR9eue
@ResolveCharity
Hope this story true. Makes ZERO sense for foreign students to be included in migration figures. Education is one of UK's greatest 'exports' &amp; creates lasting UK affiliation. Students return home after courses finish. They should be removed from figures https://t.co/b8oSOkM02z
Watch my #NewYears message as we look back on an unpredictable year in politics, and I outline some of the issues I will be fighting for in #WelwynHatfield in #2018. https://t.co/vU3ZQYdaQ5
At the old Shredded Wheat factory site in #WelwynGardenCity I saw the latest plans for 1,500 homes, offices and cafes. Building on a large brownfield site at the heart of WGC makes sense, and it's important we also get increased local services in areas like health and transport https://t.co/2PybzjnyL0
At the fantastic Mixed Group charity day lunch with a short limerick to founder Sean Cox who has arranged this amazing event for 44 years! https://t.co/3dbaCNySiF

Following our long and hard-fought successful campaign to reopen #WelwynGardenCity Post Office, I'm pleased to see Government announce £370 million funding to safeguard our rural @PostOffice network. I know many in #WelwynHatfield rely on post offices for a wide range of services https://t.co/nZafq8A1uv
I discussed #homelessness and rough sleeping on @Channel4News earlier this week. As #Housing Minister, I held monthly meetings in Downing St looking at ways to tackle problem, and set up @Tell_StreetLink which has helped 4,000 people off the streets. https://t.co/ZLv9KLkyXC
Very welcome news that @HertsPolice budget could increase by up to £6.2 million next year. Very good news, especially given recent incidents of anti-social behaviour in #WelwynHatfield. Crime has fallen by a third since 2010, but still much more to do! https://t.co/agxSlZrgxC
@Hypahippy Hi Dave hopefully you saw my earlier message. Please email me at grant@shapps.com so I can fully investigate. Thanks, Grant.
@Hypahippy Hi Dave please could you drop me an email about this so I can investigate? It's grant@shapps.com
On #LocalCharitiesDay I want to pay tribute to the incredible work charities do in #WelwynHatfield and across the country!

Fantastic news that unemployment has fallen AGAIN, and number of people in work has increased by over 3 million since 2010. UK has highest employment rate in the G7 and lowest unemployment rate since 1975! Great news for people in #WelwynHatfield! https://t.co/QSwighuys6
@se02kw Yes and I have been very critical of these proposals, and previously called for Govia to be stripped of the franchise. However please do drop me an email at grant@shapps.com so I can respond in full to your concerns
@CaseyMorgan10 Please drop me an email at grant@shapps.com so I can look into this for you
I worked with @SirBobKerslake when he was DCLG PermSec &amp; joint CabSec. But as I warned the PM at time, his sympathies firmly Labour orientated. More recently he conducted independent reviews for Labour on various issues. So Kings resignation should certainly be taken in context.
@mephistofish Not sure you've read the actual agreement, which doesn't force ECJ rulings on UK in fact
Forget the media interpretation of Friday's EU deal, I recommend reading the actual 15 page agreement here https://t.co/lRfvgmQ28g On balance I welcome the outcome, which shows we can make Brexit work for the UK. But go ahead and read it to make up your own mind.
Can't understand why @BBCr4today fail to point out to commentators who regularly claim "Canadia/EU trade deal took years, therefore UK/EU deal must take even longer", that - unlike Canadia - the UK starts with completely aligned Single Market, so in fact far less complicated!
Out with my MP’s Action Team in Handside #WelwynGardenCity at the weekend. Huge support for Drew Richardson, our fantastic local candidate in @WelHatCouncil by-election on 14th December. Great response from residents! https://t.co/Ec2Fco8dgw
For Brexit negotiations, worth noting Northern Ireland already treated differently from rest of UK  E.g. an aircraft entering/leaving NI from Britain may need to provide 12hrs up-front CUSTOMS notice. But only 4hrs notice to fly to Britain from France.
Met parents at St Michael's Woolmer Green Primary School to hear concerns about children's safety on the road, which has a 40mph speed limit. I've contacted @hertscc for an urgent update on plans to improve safety. https://t.co/CZbgia0zC1 https://t.co/C2G0hlAkaJ

Visited Ellenbrook Playground #Hatfield with local residents to see poor condition of the play equipment. It's in desperate need of repair/replacing and additional equipment for older children. I’m contacting any organisation that may be able to help the community raise funds. https://t.co/szixlMpvIE
After calling for Govia to be stripped of @GNRailUK franchise, I welcome announcement from @transportgovuk that it will be split in 2021. This will create a smaller, more local franchise better placed to meet demands/needs of #WelwynHatfield passengers. https://t.co/3cCwuFN6y8
Fantastic performance of 'Handbagged' at @BarnTheatreWGC in #WelwynGardenCity. Great evening watching a speculative account of weekly meetings between the Queen and Margaret Thatcher over 11 years as PM. Great to see #WelwynHatfield theatres putting on shows of such high quality! https://t.co/UNSdydhxZK
I was on @daily_politics earlier talking about #Budget2017 and what the UK can do to attract business/investment as we leave the EU. It’s important that Govt now gets on with negotiating #Brexit and preventing the even bigger risk of a Corbyn-led government #bbcsp https://t.co/mSf46aT0Wf
#WelwynHatfield Civic Awards 2018 nominations are open! If you know someone in our borough who has shown outstanding courage/commitment in a particular field then nominate them for a @WelHatCouncil Civic Award here: https://t.co/NskKBxUDHk
A fantastic result for #Conservative candidate Kerstin Holman in yesterday's #Hatfield Town Council by-election! Thanks to everyone who turned out to vote. I know Kerstin is keen to get straight to work representing Hatfield East residents and fighting Labour's reckless spending. https://t.co/egwN1LCKF3
Good to re-focus the @HCA_UK as 'Homes England', but what's really required is the Housing Minister to actually sit in Cabinet by right, as a Secretary of State. Then the focus will properly be on building the homes the UK desperately needs.
Excellent news that #StampDuty abolished IMMEDIATELY for first-time buyers on properties up to £300,000. This will allow many more people to get on the housing ladder! https://t.co/3Eje0sLYYi
Good to hear about £28m pilot scheme to tackle rough sleeping. As Housing Minister, I set up https://t.co/jHtsTltuKi to bring urgent assistance to anyone rough sleeping. #Budget2017
The Government is introducing a new railcard for 26-30 year olds, saving them a third off rail fares! This will be great news for many young people in #WelwynHatfield https://t.co/lyqBtDdqJW
I welcome the Govt having listened to concerns re #UniversalCredit - removing 7 day waiting period for new claims, enabling access to full month's payment within 5 days of applying, and new claimants able to access their Housing Benefit for a further two weeks. https://t.co/T0BOIojCL5

I'm concerned to see this service potentially being lost and encourage any of my constituents who share my concerns to email me at grant@shapps.com
I met with local residents on Hillfield in #Hatfield to see for myself the poor condition of the road surface. It was last resurfaced in 1989! I have urgently contacted @Herts_Highways to ask them to fix this so that everyone can use the road safely. https://t.co/US35xouwrp https://t.co/gkHpRCStNT
Unemployment in #WelwynHatfield continues to be at record lows. Good to see claimant count is down by nearly 800 since 2010. Also worth remembering that every Labour Government in history has left more people on the dole! https://t.co/ugf3zrk6zu

Met with @enherts Chief Executive Nick Carver to once again express serious concern and anger at lack of #NHS services located in #WelwynHatfield. I have made clear that services need to be brought back to our borough and I am launching a major new campaign calling for this. https://t.co/UmJarqWOw8

@jamesbarty In fairness, I did carry out trade negotiations for the UK over a 3-year period and I was often frustrated that EU meant they always stalled

.@jameschappers if I say there will be trouble...
@joejudge1 thanks. New garden cities at scale I reckon.
@JohnNofuchsia with longer to expand I would have talked about how building at scale would have meant infrastructure too of course.
.@GurtlerDavid steady on ;-)
Setting up bank account for club/society or biz now ludicrously bureaucratic, harmful to Brexit Britain &amp; needs urgent ministerial attention
Concerned that @DCMS spokesperson claims 10Mbps is sufficient to "meet the typical needs of a family". Sounds rather lacking in ambition!

Delighted my calls for JOINT ministers across @DFID_UK &amp; @ForeignOffice have been answered with @AlistairBurtUK &amp; @RoryStewartUK across both
Likely to be a new welcome emphasis on housing with former Housing Minister @GavinBarwell now the PM's Chief of Staff in @Number10gov
PM won over MPs tonight by being apologetic, frank &amp; very direct. With new No10 team it's 'May unscripted'. Time to get on w/ govt &amp; Brexit
I've worked at DfID &amp; am in favour of maintaining 0.7% development, but time to merge with FCO and back UK diplomacy at the same time.
@Matt__Murphy grant@shapps.com
Hugely welcome @GavinBarwell as new Chief of Staff in No10. Experience as MP, minister and in CCHQ. GREAT move!

Delighted &amp; honoured to have been re-selected this evening as Welwyn Hatfield's Conservative candidate for the 8th June general election. https://t.co/OvjMAY35hf
Believe that this last #PMQs of the parliament is also the longest on record.  Time given to numerous MPs standing down to ask questions
Sunday papers stuffed full of opinion polls. What a resilient industry, given their abject failure to predict either last election or Brexit

@lovethedata you're right. Misread.

@lovethedata interested to know what alternative you'd propose though... Dictatorship?

Here's what Ed Miliband meant to say and what he actually said in today's Labour conference speech &gt; http://t.co/JOIar5z2Da
I'll be speaking to @IainDale on @LBC about Miliband's failure to make even a passing reference to the deficit http://t.co/0v2P5rqwwx
Striking: EdMili spoke for over an hr yet completely failed to outline any plan for  economy. He only wants to divide the cake never grow it

Well done @RuthDavidsonMSP @DavidMundellMP and all @scottories for helping Scotland stay with us. #indyref
Cameron announces that English votes for English laws will be introduced at the same time as more powers for Scotland, following the NO vote
Whatever #IndyRef outcome; Conservatives have fought tooth &amp; nail for Union - meaning we do what's right, not what's in our narrow interest

There are 2 certainties in life – death &amp; Labour putting up taxes. Now Miliband wants to combine the 2. My COMMENT &gt; http://t.co/1LhyT25Zxo
@labourpress we do publish it. Another error in @tamcohen story. Don't know how to break this to you, but not everything in papers is true.
I'll be discussing Labour's latest plans for a 'Death Tax' on @LBC after 3.30pm. Listen in http://t.co/96W8fDFZDE

There are only two things certain in life; death and Labour taxes. Now they want to combine them both! http://t.co/lBMSj8Jqua
@petergabscar no, it was just inaccurate by a large multiple factor and @BuzzFeedUK has now issued update.
@Raadedendron happy to have a sensible debate, but throwing terms like monster around not helpful.
.@BuzzFeedUK based on a false comparison. UKIP collects membership centrally, @Conservatives locally - article ignores c£15m remains local
@PickardJE Lab also collects membership centrally, whereas we collect locally - equates to c£15m a yr in small sums, not included in our a/c
@PickardJE 1. We became debt free THIS May (not last yr). 2. We don't inc. Association assets (i.e. buildings) centrally, where Lab do.

@OwenJones84 yes I'm serious. Rent controls restrict supply and worsen standards.
Once rent controls were scrapped, the no. of homes available for rent DOUBLED, the quality of properties improved &amp; satisfaction improved.
Ed Miliband determined take UK backwards. Rent controls SHRUNK the rented sector from 55% in 1939 to just 8% by the late 80s.

@number1hatfield @no1hatfield @Peoples_health great to visit and see the great work being done. Plus thanks to the @HealthLottery funding.

Packed constituency Friday w/ visit to @HealthLottery No1 Hatfield project, MPs Surgery, Homerswood Sch, Grace Foods, meet EA, LEP &amp; NHS!
@roryyeomans Not that there's not an issue with rents, but that Miliband's mad cap rent cap response would fail. Just as it did previously!
@scottagnelson @wdt1967 @arobson58 regardless of who you vote for, I work hard for all my constituents, including you.
Lab Lord Glassman in Jan, "We've really got to get out of the idea that capping something is going to solve a long-term structural problem."
I'll shortly be discussing Labour's 'mad-cap rent-cap' policy on @LBC with @IainDale shortly. Listen in http://t.co/xMyTG2xHwi
Out of interest, according to the ONS, across England rents have risen by 1% which is less than inflation both CPI &amp; RPI over the past year
Supply of Rent-able homes would dry up as landlords withdraw from the market. So LESS choice forcing vulnerable to accept poorer standards.
The DCLG Select Committee says Rent Controls "would serve only to reduce investment in the sector", leading to poorer quality accommodation!
RENT CAPPING has been tried in the UK before. It helped shrink the Private Rented Sector from 55% to 8% by the time the policy was scrapped!
TO FOLLOW: Some tweets on Labour's 'rent cap' housing policy. Why it would hurt the most vulnerable and is one of their worst ideas to date!

@oznoghill given the private sector has created 1.4m new jobs and far fewer public sector have been lost, your argument doesn't stack up!

@KieranThorpe he's weak because he does whatever Len McCluskey tells him to do!
@IainDale @Ratcatcher7 @GrantShapps it may have just slipped out. And is of course true, in part because the new ministers will work v hard!
@KieranThorpe @SkyNews I agree. What they want is a govt dealing w/ deficit, cut by 1/3rd, making welfare work, securing the recovery.
Discussing how our #reshuffle is designed to support hardworking ppl, whilst Ed Miliband's is designed to satisfy Len McCluskey on @SkyNews

Miliband's conference housing promise reminiscent of Brown's failed 3m homes plan http://t.co/E8RyiItgw0
@volcanicdust that's wrong. We've reduced tax for 25m, removed 2.7m lowest paid from paying tax entirely. But top 10% paying higher burden!
@Lance63 a party for everyone but in particular the 2.7m hard-working low paid that we're taking out of tax entirely by April.
@LoganBanks2 er, thanks, I think!  It is a serious point I was raising. Tricky in 140chars. And to the wrong Ed M twitter as it turned out.
@pointlessrantin works for his or her constituents/residents.
@volcanicdust what? Given we both hate fascists, what do you mean?
EdM's promise to build 200k homes a yr reminds me of Brown's boast of 3m new homes - just as Labour house building collapsed to 1920s level!
@shanebrown74 can you explain why Labour removed housing benefit for spare rooms for people in the private rented sector?
@jellychrissy that's factually untrue. Homelessness was twice the average level under Labour compared to my time as housing minister.
Each time @EdMilliblandMP says he'll use taxpayer cash to pay for 1m empty rooms he needs to explain to homeless they'll going stay that way
@campbellclaret @frasernelson checked, found your launch event is outside the zone. So unclear why needed? Great book btw. Thx.
RT @samanthafulton: @grantshapps just got on my train &gt; Say hello next time :-)
RT @KateWrighttt: @grantshapps got on our train just now #fangirling #welwynhatfield &gt; You didn't say hi though :-(
#Lab13 enthusiastically cheers @EdMilliblandMP saying he'll increase business taxes to (effectively) drive jobs away from Britain. Bonkers!
@frasernelson @campbellclaret they bought it all using a ballooning deficit, expecting future generations to pay for their boom!
@FrankBowron - @KieranThorpe likes to forget that housing waiting lists doubled under Labour, but we're building more &amp; using homes better.

@ArthurTwittter okay, but be aware your actions can only lead to Miliband as PM and no referendum.
@MikeHobday afraid it's all looking a bit gloomy for your man ;-) Hope you're doing well though M.
@abikay45 you're right, but we can help provide the conditions for business, jobs and trade.
@LyndaPons that's totally wrong because we do trade billions of non manufactured services, but we also trade a lot of manufactured too

Looking forward to meeting Chorley's prospective MP @Rob_loughenbury this lunchtime @guardianchorley @leponline

@LABOURHULK who said Tory speeches don't have their uses HULK?
@vickywong710 haha. I meant your pic with Vince btw obv.
@KieranThorpe no Kieran because that's not what I said in 2010. Please check your facts!
@vickywong710 not as funny as that guy in your profile pic :-)
@chrisf91 as you say in your own profile, nothing you say should be taken seriously ;-)

@graemeaitken3 @Filesxxx @BBC3CR because where's the outrage that housing waiting lists doubled?
About to discuss how the spare room subsidy is helping people on the waiting list on @BBC3CR http://t.co/iQgSDiKWUZ

@BriJoyce twelve quid for three!
@AGilinsky @chrstinadarling @RooKnight ah, should have mentioned it was for three of us!
@No_Supermarket you wouldn't say that if you sat through my constituency surgeries.
@AugusTyme requires NFC so rules out iPhones.

Labour's argument for more borrowing has collapsed. But today Ed Balls still says he would borrow £16.3bn more this yr #sameoldlabour Pls RT
On the right track. Thank goodness we didn’t listen to @edballsmp who said we must change course. Labour only offer more borrowing.
UK economy growing by 0.6% showing that we're on the right track, reducing deficit &amp; building Britain where hardworking people can get on.

@marthasydenham Union members join for the services provided, but sadly the membership is poorly served by union barons like Len McCluskey
Did ITV clip: Crosby gives campaign advice to us, but doesn't pick candidates, install leader or write policy - unlike Mili's Union barons!
McCluskey says he'll spend MORE fixing candidate selections! Rather than challenging him, weak Ed Miliband just smears Lynton Crosby instead
@PW0559 great :-)

@cjball_london can you find even a single quote from me to back up your mistaken assertion about the use of language please?
@cjball_london hope you'll forgive me for saying, meant respectfully, but you're showing your own prejudice when you write such tweets.
@cjball_london afraid it's your pre-conceived and completely mistaken views about Conservatives that lead you the wrong conclusions.
@cjball_london no, v few deliberately don't work. It's about changing a system that too often prevents people getting back into employment.
@cjball_london no that's wrong. I'm as angry about the senseless waste of lives for individuals stuck in system as I am the cost to society!
@scottahurrell @cjball_london inconvenient to your argument but gap between rich &amp; poor has in fact narrowed say ONS http://t.co/pLtnARHGdL
@IsabelHardman @paulwaugh @KirstyBuchanan4 ok politicos, here's that interview hedge + bit of tree in Technicolor http://t.co/EMcOMjnwkj
@cjball_london no that would be irresponsible. However changing a welfare system that traps people out of work is entirely right.
@CllrPaulWhite @gscolamiero_93 @BritainDecides nice work :-)
@cjball_london don't be ridiculous.
@BCollier2012 lol. They were amongst my favourite ads as luck would have it.

About to discuss the new welfare cap on @bbcnews so no household gets more in benefit than the average working family.
@Harryb22 yes I know. Fixed!
@wendy211 my bad

Telegraph report on Labour's 'secret plan' to make claiming benefits a human right http://t.co/i3PBfC5GI9
@deletedbyMPs but only because I'd made a typo, calling @SteveRotheram  'the'. Sorry Steve.
@TheKnowledgeNow and that unemployment is currently slightly lower than at the last election. So which bit are you saying was wrong?
@TheKnowledgeNow it's also a fact that at 29.76m there are now more people working in this country than ever before.
@TheKnowledgeNow but it is a fact that more businesses registered at Companies House last year than ever before.
@TheKnowledgeNow how so? Explain more?
@AmberElliottSky @paulwaugh right, where did I put those shears?
@QuietNotStupid I know you desperately want this to be the case, but you're just plain wrong about it.

@JoeatTheHub as much as you, but I think they're stretching the definition.
@HallElliott well you'd be wrong.
@gingerblokeblog thanks. Now is not the time.
@HackneyAbbott I voted for that ban &amp; it was the right thing to do, but evidence had been gathered from elsewhere so we knew it would help.

Miliband union proposals labelled “unworkable” with “groundwork not done” by former Labour Gen Sec Lord Whitty. Abt to discuss on @bbc5live
Ed Miliband still refusing to investigate what has happened in 41 candidate selections Len McCluskey's Unite union has been trying to fix!
Ed Miliband's opt-in proposal is completely dead in the water. Len McCluskey, Lab biggest union donor, has already said no!  #SameOldLabour
Too little too late? @Ed_Miliband calls crisis meeting with Labour MPs tonight as infighting &amp; splits in the Labour Party continue to grow!

About to talk to @SkyNews about Miliband's no more spending speech. This from party who've voted against every single penny of reductions!
Pre-recorded itv abt Ed Miliband's unbelievable no more spending speech today. Yeah, right. Lab still don't admit they over-spent in power!
@petergcampbell doh, that's fixed.
Today Miliband will make a speech promising to build more homes, without knowing his new 'Use it or lose it' policy already exists! Oh dear.
