Pleasure to speak at the @MakeUK_ Manufacturers Association. Our #manufacturing sector is and must remain one of the UK’s distinctive strengths. If we can get it right - focusing on skills, innovation and infrastructure - the sector can and will prosper. https://t.co/MZGKdf6s6l https://t.co/4vnsAL14u6
Good news from @ONS today:   -The unemployment rate has not been lower since 1975 -426,000 more people are in full-time work than a year ago  -Wages are still growing at their fastest pace in over a decade -With inflation falling, this means more money in people’s pockets https://t.co/ffALMVTzPQ
I’ve asked the @NatInfraCom to look at how regulators can prepare for and adapt to technological change. Their findings will help ensure the UK rises to these challenges and remains fit for the future. https://t.co/fHToan6z2A
We have a responsibility to leave this planet in a better state than we found it. Today, I’m calling on businesses and individuals to have their say on the new #plasticpackagingtax  https://t.co/f4VexgV4Lo https://t.co/9XzJPIxv1z
Good news for consumers, new @ONS figures show #inflation fell to 1.8% last month. With wages rising at their fastest pace in over a decade, this government is helping people keep more money in their pockets. https://t.co/UpkcoyQe5c
Today, the Finance Act 2019 has received Royal Assent, meaning important changes we announced at Budget will come into force in the Spring – including raising the personal allowance and higher rate threshold and cutting taxes for millions of people a year early. https://t.co/5QOjhx0kvP
Here is my response to today’s #GDP figures. https://t.co/AdGyXFvakl
NEW: Investing in skills is essential to boosting our productivity and I’ve invested £5 million into @uniofglos’ new School of Business and Technology.   It will bring together the best of academic and business expertise to develop the business leaders of the future. https://t.co/P5jq7sw6Vu
Wishing a happy #ChineseNewYear to all those celebrating around the world and in the UK. https://t.co/9hauA0Fgmt
In #Budget2017 I commissioned research into barriers facing women in accessing venture capital. @BritishBBank found #FemaleFounders pitching for venture capital get less funding than male founders. We must address this issue head on to realise the true potential for our economy. https://t.co/orw93UzXH6
The North West is home to some amazing innovators, like those I met at @SensorCityUK today who are making great advances in technology – that’s why in the last 5 years we’ve backed £2.5bn of investment in the region’s entrepreneurs. https://t.co/eDkFhACa4a
At the Budget, I froze duty on beer, cider and spirits which would have risen today. Great to visit @Craft_Beers in #Liverpool to see how the measure has helped keep costs down for brewers, distillers and pub-goers alike. https://t.co/s49hXT0xNS
The UK is well positioned to grow financial services exports to some of the world’s fastest expanding markets when we leave the EU. This was my message to @TheCityUK this evening. https://t.co/ZzJaqCZQEJ

We must fight against those who continue to spread antisemitism and we must never forget its victims. At the Budget we committed to spend £1.7 million on educational programmes to ensure the next generation hears the stories of those who survived the holocaust #WeRemember
As I said to @CBItweets, when the history of the 21st century is written, it will not be about #Brexit. It will be about a tech revolution of which the world had never seen before, with the UK leading the way. That was message to @Davos #WEF19 https://t.co/c0u0Hjm1lB
Spirits will be high this #BurnsNight, but the cost won’t be. We froze the tax on spirits for a second year in a row last year, saving you money on a bottle of whisky. Wishing everyone a wonderful evening. https://t.co/MPPiu2TunV
Today in @Davos, Ueli Maurer and I signed an agreement which will ensure the UK and Swiss #insurance sectors can continue trading freely with one another after #Brexit.

Britain is a great place to do business. We're leading the way in the tech revolution but to remain the standard-bearer we must invest in our new economy so it can adapt and remain competitive.   Read my full @davos #CBI speech:  https://t.co/MSosZWx6Dy
Today’s ONS data shows we’re on track with our plan to reduce the deficit. Compared to this point in previous years, the deficit is the lowest in 16 years. Debt is now falling on a sustained basis for the first time in a generation. https://t.co/FKjZcPNAmc
This government promised to build a stronger, fairer economy that’s fit for the future and that’s what we’re doing. According to @ONS, employment is at a record high, wages are up 3.4% and growing faster than inflation, helping hardworking families keep more of what they earn. https://t.co/zitJw3kJCM
80,000 people have already signed up for @HMRCgovuk’s new savings account Help to Save. If you’re in work and on tax credits or Universal Credit, you could be eligible for an extra 50p on every £1 you save   https://t.co/8Upimly9PS
Today marks 10 years since the Government bailed out the banks a second time during the financial crisis. Since then, we’ve led the way in introducing some of the highest regulatory standards in the world to ensure the taxpayers are never put in that position again. https://t.co/KYXF795jDP
The @PoppyLegion trip will be supporting hundreds of veterans in commemorating D-Day. The trip is part funded by fines levied on the banking industry for manipulating the LIBOR rate. It’s right that this funding goes towards the heroes who fought for our freedom. https://t.co/tyrUCgxnRq
Good news for UK households as inflation falls to 2.1% in December, wages are rising at their fastest pace in almost a decade and we're cutting income tax for 32 million people, which will mean more money in people's pockets. https://t.co/A9atxjzuUH
I strongly back @theresa_may as she reaches out across the House to build a political consensus to deliver a negotiated Brexit deal that honours the referendum result while protecting Britain's jobs, business and prosperity.
Today’s vote in the @HouseofCommons is one of the most important decisions Parliament will ever make. @theresa_may has secured the best possible #Brexit deal, one that protects jobs, security and the integrity of the UK. So let’s end the division and #BacktheBrexitDeal.
Fraudsters rob the public of £4.7 billion each year - it's deplorable. That’s why @sajidjavid and I have setup the Economic Crime Strategic Board, a new partnership with the private sector dedicated to fighting economic crime and stopping the flow of illicit finance. https://t.co/ZTciPweZkD
Figures out today reveal London attracted £1.8bn of tech funding last year - almost double the amount of its closest European competitor. This is good news for jobs and good news for the new economy. https://t.co/SlqK45GSwz
Pensions fraud ruins lives, that's why today we've banned pensions cold-calling, a primary tactic used by scammers. This means firms that make unwanted phone calls to people about their pensions may face fines of up to £500,000. https://t.co/pQETQAkxek

We want people to achieve the dream of home ownership, so it’s great that first-time buyers bought half of all homes last year, according to @Yorkshire_BS. Our policies like Help to Buy are helping 100,000’s of families get on the housing ladder   https://t.co/rxujKwDYEc
2018 was a great year for British TV and films with the likes of Killing Eve and Bodyguard keeping us gripped. It’s vital that we support productions like these to help them thrive on an increasingly global stage – which is why last year we supported them with over £850 million. https://t.co/8RuMc1TdnF
Wishing everyone a Happy New Year, with a particular thank you to my ministerial team and all the staff at @HMTreasury for their hard work in managing our economy and preparing our country for a bright future outside the EU. https://t.co/nXBXJykBqL
Tomorrow we're increasing the Annual Investment Allowance five-fold to £1 million to help businesses invest and grow.   This delivers a longstanding ask of @britishchambers https://t.co/uY9J8MoHum
Wishing everyone across our great United Kingdom a very Merry Christmas. https://t.co/YbN47Whwxs
My thoughts are with the family and friends of Paddy Ashdown. He dedicated his life to public service and will be greatly missed.
It's this Government’s ambition to reduce borrowing and get our national debt down, because our children should not be left to pick up our bill. Last month was the lowest year-to-date borrowing for 16 years, so it's clear our balanced approach is working. https://t.co/6WIr32pFz1
.@sajidjavid has announced a new immigration white paper which involves close consultation with business. As we move towards a migration regime based on skills, I welcome the commitment to consider the needs of business &amp; the economy to ensure continuing prosperity post-Brexit.
.@hmtreasury has provided over £4.2bn to prepare for Brexit since 2016. Now we're allocating over £2bn of that fund to continue work in 2019-20. A responsible government prepares for all contingencies, which is why we’re also stepping up no deal planning. https://t.co/AG6oQnHs7X
Since the late 1800s the Chancellor of the Exchequer has also been the Master of the Mint, a ceremonial title given to me by the @RoyalMintUK, who make and distribute the UK’s coins and official medals. Today marks 50 years since the Mint moved to Wales. https://t.co/4Q3Eu229Y7
Maintaining our world-leading police forces is a priority for this government which is why @sajidjavid and I have agreed to a provisional police funding settlement of up to £14bn – up to £970million more than the previous year and the largest increase in funding since 2010. https://t.co/3zc8FIwt0d
Tonight's vote of confidence in the Prime Minister @theresa_may, is the right one. Now is the time to focus on the future. Her deal means we will honour the referendum result while safeguarding jobs and maintaining business confidence.
The Prime Minister has worked hard in the National interest since the day she took office and will have my full support in the vote tonight. Her deal means we leave the EU on time, whist protecting our jobs and our businesses.
At Bloomberg’s Global Regulatory Forum this afternoon I reiterated what we’re doing to ensure the UK remains the global centre for international finance. We will build new financial partnerships with international markets and champion robust international standards. https://t.co/GIJhsuZgeS
In the @HouseofCommons I reiterated this Conservative government’s commitment to keeping taxes low and helping people keep more of what they earn by bringing forward changes to the personal allowance and the higher rate threshold one year early. https://t.co/0yQubRHXOo
New @ONS figures are a real boost for families across the UK ahead of Christmas as wages rose by 3.3%, the fastest pace in 10 years. The number of people in work is at a record high, supported by people in full time jobs while the number of people out of work continues to fall. https://t.co/pQc2WPsGOU
I want to thank all of the truly inspirational children and families who came to No 11 today for the @Starlight_uk Christmas party. It is always an honour to host the event for a charity that brightens the lives of children living with serious illness across the UK. https://t.co/jRLifnBKNS
Speaking to @BBCSurrey about how the deal we have negotiated with the EU delivers on the referendum while protecting jobs, security and the integrity of the United Kingdom. It’s time to #BackTheBrexitDeal and prepare for a bright future outside the EU. https://t.co/Qs7FcB4viw

According to @FATFnews the UK has some of the world's strongest protections against money laundering. But we can do more. Which is why we’ll continue to toughen our defences to find and prosecute anyone dealing in illicit finance. There is no place for these criminals in the UK. https://t.co/Dc2ANfmy3a
This year's No11 Christmas cards feature the return of my dogs, Rex and Oscar. https://t.co/qWAnHeB4c3
I will shortly be making the case to @HouseofCommons for backing the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal. It will: ensure an orderly #Brexit, deliver on the referendum decision, and secure a close economic &amp; security partnership with our nearest neighbours. #BackTheBrexitDeal
A responsible government must prepare for all scenarios, which is why I have made more than £4.2bn available for EU exit planning since 2016. In the coming days, @hmtreasury will allocate a further £2bn of that money to government departments to bolster #Brexit preparations. https://t.co/9m6IiQYuRM
The amount of tax our financial sector brings in continues to grow. This year it has increased by 4% to £75bn - the highest on @cityoflondon records. That's £2.9bn more to spend on our vital public services. https://t.co/gCm6lkakgQ

NEW: For the eighth consecutive year the government is donating the VAT on all sales of this year’s #XFactor single to children’s hospices, @Tog4ShortLives and @SSChospices. Every single you buy will help fund their crucial work.
Saddened to hear about the death of former US President, George H. W. Bush. He was a great statesman and highly revered. His time in politics faced more challenges than most and he will be sorely missed across the globe. My thoughts are with his family and friends.
I want to wish everyone in Scotland a happy #StAndrewsDay. Through #Budget2018 I was able to invest more money in Scotland’s future – including a £950 million funding boost and freezes to the Spirits Duty to support Scotch Whisky. https://t.co/9YVcunXRim
My first of many meetings with the world's Finance Ministers at #G20 was with Chinese Minister Liu Kun. When I last visited Beijing, the Chinese ban on British beef was lifted – a landmark move for British producers estimated to be worth £250m in the first 5 years alone 🇬🇧🇨🇳 https://t.co/ClIE6tp5Fa

Good news from the @ONS today: employment in the UK is at a record high and wages are growing at their fastest pace in almost ten years. But it's important that people's hard-earned money goes further, that's why at the Budget we cut taxes and froze fuel duty again. https://t.co/SC7suNVBbv

This government is delivering for hard-working people as the latest data shows the proportion of low paid jobs is at a record low. The lowest earners working full-time have seen the fastest pay rises and the full-time gender pay gap is the lowest since records began. https://t.co/WSCkcwAgWU
Labour claim they represent the ‘many and not the few’ but their reckless approach would put the successes achieved by the British people at risk. From unemployment at a 40 year low to pay growing at its fastest rate in 10 years, we'd all pay the price, just like last time https://t.co/f078QlkY3o
.@ONS shows we're borrowing £10.7bn less than last year and borrowing this month is the lowest for 11 years. We've made strong progress fixing our finances, so we can support public services, keep taxes low and keep debt falling. We're building an economy that works for everyone. https://t.co/OyLKiBMAaf
NEW: More good news for consumers: inflation fell to 2.4% last month, equal to its lowest rate in 2018.  Wages growing at the fastest rate in nearly a decade in the three months to August, income tax cuts and frozen fuel duty help the money of hard working families go further. https://t.co/NPF41z6yfL

Labour’s spending promises would cost £1 trillion over a decade - the equivalent of £3,500 a year for every UK household.  They would create more borrowing and higher debt, leaving ordinary hard-working families paying the price, just like last time. https://t.co/AQj4TAtMmX
Latest @ONS figures show our economy grew 0.7% between June and August with retail, food and drink and housebuilding all performing well during the summer.

New @ONS stats show productivity grew 1.4% in the last year – the fastest rate since 2016.

Labour are confirming that they would embark on a £176 billion borrowing binge in the first year of a Labour government.   Ideological renationalisation would lead to less choice and poorer services.  We would all pay the price for that – just like last time. https://t.co/T0rSzGJBGU
Government borrowing for the year-to-date is £7.8 billion lower than the same period last year according to @ONS.   This is good progress but we need to keep up our efforts so we can invest in our public services and our future. https://t.co/BfVx12SxKD

Promising news as @ONS stats show unemployment at its lowest since the 1970s. Since 2010, 3m more people are in work and most of these are full time jobs.  Real wages are rising.

I’m @the_MTC_org in Coventry to see how they’re creating new technologies and training our future workforce.    It’s firms like these that will create the highly skilled jobs of the future we urgently need – that’s why we’re backing them with almost £1bn of investment. https://t.co/U0WNIsSJqA

We’ve been clearing up Labour’s mess and cutting the deficit, but Corbyn wants to go backwards with £500 billion more spending and borrowing

The choice is clear: low taxes with PM @theresa_may or higher taxes with Jeremy Corbyn. #VoteConservative
Jeremy Corbyn’s nonsensical economic ideas would put our growing economy at grave risk with higher taxes -
