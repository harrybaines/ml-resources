@michaelgove our focus should be on delivering for the British people - and respecting their wishes
Conservatives always put national interest first - vital the PM is given strong support for key Queen's Speech and Brexit talks

Corbyn exposed as never before tonight - higher taxes and borrowing - lower growth and lowered defences - a disaster for Britain #bbct
The iPlayer comes into its own https://t.co/FZC9D5lWA4

@MPritchardUK quite right Mark - red flag replaced by white flag

Sir Nicholas nails it #ateverymomentofnationalperilaChurchillshowsthewayandweshouldheedthisancestralvoiceofwisdom https://t.co/DOE4jpJTdj
We should listen to @TomTugendhat - a brave man who fought for peace https://t.co/krECYdvrJB
Corbyn can't bring himself to unequivocally condemn IRA killers who targeted innocents and British squaddies - he can't keep us safe #bbcqt
We all are! I just hope they're not watching in Tehran and Pyongyang https://t.co/YkwZqslLOT
Corbyn totally tanking on defence and the deterrent - he says he would NEVER use trident - he'd leave us open to nuclear blackmail #bbcqt
JC can't be trusted on defence or fighting terror - instead of speaking up for UK he'd just sing kumbaya #bbcqt
@JohnRentoul actions speak louder than words
JC just doesn't care about the anti semites in his ranks https://t.co/k37p9hHuL0
Absolutely -@NadineDorries gets to the heart of his hypocrisy https://t.co/z8aGSpJ9vp
@michaelgove but then he thinks Hizbollah and Hamas are friends #everydayantisemitism #bbcqt
How can Corbyn excuse Ken's anti-semitism in this way? #bbcqt
That #bbcqt questioner is right - the Labour Manifesto is a letter to Father Christmas - but reading it - there ain't no sanity clause

On education PM's passion for social mobility comes through - more school choice, supporting great teachers, higher standards #bbcqt
PM in command of the issues, facts and arguments - dealing with tough questions with aplomb
No front rank politician has done more to champion better mental health than the PM - she will change the law to help those in need #bbcqt
Nadine knows whereof she speaks #angel #bbcqt https://t.co/OK2XjWEAij
On Social Care PM crystal clear - both a cap on what anyone pays and a floor which guarantees savings protected #bbcqt
PM quite right on manifesto - Conservatives only party to be straight about the big challenges Britain faces - and show leadership #bbcqt
On Brexit deal PM is calm, clear, coherent - she will deliver what we voted for #bbcqt
PM Bossing it #bbcqt https://t.co/QP5vpEwNNe

PM nails it - only the Conservatives believe in respecting the referendum result and delivering a successful Brexit #bbcqt
PM gets to the heart of it - we can't risk a Labour/SNP/Lib Dem coalition mishandling these critical Brexit negotiations in 11 days time
Strong, clear, robust articulation of reforming record at Home Office by PM #bbcqt
A cabal of chaos - doesn't bear thinking about #bbcqt https://t.co/tiDFqfaaS4

@afuahirsch Corbyn refers to Hamas and Hizbollah as friends while Lib Dem David Ward fans anti/semitism - the real racism in this GE
@afuahirsch it's not the Tories who have to purge anti-semites from the ranks of their PPCs -
@miqdaad @SarahLudford don't defend David Ward's ugly anti semitism with this infantile whataboutery - call out your own anti-Jewish bigots
@RuthDavidsonMSP @1edmountain @edinburghpaper a rare example of Alex putting ego before party

@mikercameron @michael_merrick no it puts me on the side of children, teachers, discipline, the common good and educational excellence
@hrtbps it's about time we had an end to your empty cynical nihilism - and also honesty about who you are #moralcoward
@kirancmoodley @jdportes @ShashiTharoor @Channel4News very powerful /but only one narrow view

@rstrongdoctor and mine at you
@chappy7778 and you're responsible for reducing reasoned debate to shallow name calling #nightofthetrolls
@cobainhetfield quite agree
@WesleyBrownLab @KirstieMAllsopp you've proved my point - why do you pollute the public square with your ignorance and profanity?
@rstrongdoctor are you?
@Jololololf @KirstieMAllsopp you are a disgrace - sexist bullying and inarticulately offensive
@hugorifkind Dear Hugo - no need for expletives -the truth is there are many brilliant Tory comic voices - just never heard on BBC
@michael_merrick @mikercameron it is no part of parental responsibility to encourage truantism - freedom is not license
@BigMac84815577 @PolhomeEditor what on earth do you know?
Just read some of social media/twitter abuse directed at @KirstieMAllsopp - those responsible are disgusting
@michael_merrick @mikercameron thank you for kind words. But on what rational basis should we be lax on truanting? #bluelabourvalues
@mikercameron @michael_merrick but where is the evidence to support your position?
@mikercameron @michael_merrick Dear Mike -on this issue you're on the side of the "play is as valuable as learning" crowd - anti  knowledge

Deja vu https://t.co/aFWq4J0HqY
@chuculchethhigh @tes I'm genuinely not sure what your point is here - please do clarify - if re UTCs then yes - entry at 14 a mistake
@chuculchethhigh @tes Free Schools more likely to be outstanding - and reforms overall mean 1.8 million more in good/outstanding schools
@AndyCart2531 @tes I'd be grateful for your view on them
@pompeygeorge @tes no - a knowledge based curriculum is the best preparation for the challenges we now face
@Nick5307 @tes there's a great deal - 1.8 million more children in good or outstanding schools
@at2__1 @tes which comment?
Nuance https://t.co/v4ePNwIXf7
@tes Thoughtful critiques of our changes are necessary to drive further improvements but sadly too much criticism is light on facts
@tes The Academy and Free School movements have liberated great school leaders - and our education system is now much more school-led
@tes the national curriculum was a collaborative endeavour - shaped by teachers, academics, learned societies and superb civil servants
@tes a well written letter but wrong on the civil service, the national curriculum and on leadership - our reforms were led by gr8 officials
A very helpful analysis https://t.co/FWmL2AVDYT

@ms_peaceweaver @miss_mcinerney because he's the President of America
@stefanstern @miss_mcinerney Dear Stefan - when you lead reforms in a vital Government department I'll be happy to hear from you
@miss_mcinerney and the free schools you opposed and scorned outperforming other schools as outstanding #timeforsomeschoolsweekbalanceatlast
@miss_mcinerney plus a school food plan the world is copying and a culture plan that meant more for music and dance than ever before
@miss_mcinerney more working class students doing maths, physics, chemistry, biology, history, geography and languages - so freer to choose
@miss_mcinerney bogus vocational equivalence ended - working class children given new opportunities - funding protected in real terms
@miss_mcinerney Teach First massively expanded - Frontline established - schools built more cheaply - teacher quality on an upward trend
@miss_mcinerney Dear Laura 1.8 million more children in good or outstanding schools - grade inflation ended - the pupil premium embedded
A brilliant piece from the always insightful @JGForsyth https://t.co/aY63l4OB0P
@Liam_O_Hare the Israeli state isn't racist - the people who want to delegitimise it are
@goodclimate I do - the EU has inflicted economic misery on Europe's poorest
@mumu23k no they're not
@Liam_O_Hare nonsensical evidence-free avoidance of the central issue - do you support or condemn this anti-Semitic nonsense?
@JonathanRomelle indeed
The whole notion of "israel apartheid week" is morally repugnant anti-Semitic hate speech https://t.co/YiiZQkNbPT

@andyburnhammp @guardian Happy to answer for 1.8 million more children in good or outstanding schools and money spent more effectively
@michaelgove and also David Laws ! A really quite superb Minister
@michaelgove civil servants who did a great job - inc Peter Launer, Chris Wormald, Pamela Dow, Vicky Woodcock, Rose Pennells  + Sue Baldwin
@michaelgove I should add that the real heroes in this work have been Jonathan Hill, John Nash, Sir Theo Agnew, Seb James and countless DFE
@michaelgove and they both increase capacity, provide innovation  and raise standards - just visit Michaela to see how transformative
@michaelgove in addition it's important to note Free Schools are more likely to be ranked outstanding than other state schools
@michaelgove the report makes clear we built new capacity in good and outstanding schools rapidly and improved renovation and repair work
@michaelgove the Labour Government had no effective plan to deal with rising pupil numbers and no decent info on the condition of the estate
@michaelgove thanks to a series of changes - including the Sebastian James review - schools are now built much more efficiently
@michaelgove it's important to realise that capital spending was in a huge mess when we took office in 2010 - BSF was shockingly wasteful
Have read NAO report on school capital - it makes clear that our reforms mean spending is more effective and new school places better
@ShipBrief - well they both get people salivating...

A brilliant initiative from a brave man in a great cause https://t.co/y5TJ2qMxWu
@RobDotHutton I fear your own views occlude clear sightedness on what Sir Ivan has been saying
@RobDotHutton @IanDunt I think he's been very helpful to the Government - and indeed to the Committee
@IanDunt Of course! Sir Ivan is a distinguished public servant and his testimony very helpful
@NHoppo it's not the European Scrutiny Committee Sir Ivan is talking to and Bill Cash isn't here - but apart from that you're spot on
But he wears them so well https://t.co/TXvEc4PVzT

@GarethBQuinn @joannaccherry @CommonsEUexit @Feorlean I fear that the Scottish Govt minister said on the record they'd pay billions to EU
@joannaccherry @CommonsEUexit @Feorlean Either Mike doesn't know what's in his own document or doesn't care #billionsfortheEU
@joannaccherry @CommonsEUexit I fearJoanna was let down by @Feorlean - the tape shows he said billions was a price worth paying
For interested parties - the SNP saying that £3.3 billion of cuts to the Scottish budget would be a price worth paying to stay in EEA https://t.co/QmcQnzNDDd
Thanks to @Feorlean for acknowledging SNP plans means Scotland still paying into EU and no control over banks, oil or gas!

@NicolaSturgeon NHS bonus after Brexit! but you cant explain Scotland's slip in PISA rankings or decline in poor students going to uni -
@NicolaSturgeon @StevePeers @afneil and a school system falling behind England plus cuts to Further Education and fewer poor students at uni

@olongworth1 @guardian @rafaelbehr thank you !
@KevinNebula @guardian @rafaelbehr if you think 17.4 million are "racist" for believing in democracy then prejudice is your problem
@chrissansome85 no
@LucianGeorge1 I am v impressed by Polanyi - not least his critique of the Speenhamland system #GreatTransformation
@stodrinkwater no
@olongworth1 @guardian @rafaelbehr I fear that is a sadly accurate description of The Guardian
@KevinNebula @guardian @rafaelbehr do please pay attention to what was actually said - and why people voted as they did
@guardian @rafaelbehr I admire the author but this is such a total misunderstanding of both party and the EU vote it takes my breath away
