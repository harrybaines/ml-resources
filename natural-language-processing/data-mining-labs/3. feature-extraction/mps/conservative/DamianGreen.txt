Thanks to @InvictaChamber for another lively exchange with Ashford businesses. Roads, GPS, banks, and young workers all discussed.
Eight Kent MPs have written to Highways England asking for fewer hours of night time closure on the M20 while the contraflow barrier is built. We want to protect local roads from congestion.
Today I met with @CRUK_Policy ambassadors to mark #WorldCancerDay and hear about the work they're doing to beat cancer soon. I'm wearing my #UnityBand for the 730 people in Ashford diagnosed with cancer each year. https://t.co/DY7DSLY5sK

Interesting email from all UK Farmers’ Unions saying they “simply cannot countenance” No Deal. Farmers voted heavily to leave, so it show that Brexit and No Deal are not the same thing.

Theresa May will fight to get us a good deal with the EU and a deep and special partnership with our European neighbours #BattleforNumber10
Giving British people the skills they need is critical for a strong economy, that's why we have increased apprenticeships #BattleforNumber10
Unlike Jeremy Corbyn, Theresa May takes responsibility for the decisions she's taken - no waffling evasions or excuses #BattleforNumber10
We have an ageing society; a Conservative gov will put social care on a long term sustainable footing #BattleforNumber10
Absolutely right for Gov to respect referendum result. Theresa May is the only PM who will get the best deal for Britain #BattleforNumber10
Theresa May is the right PM to lead Britain through the challenges ahead unlike Corbyn who refuses to acknowledge them #BattleforNumber10
Conservative gov has been working with NHS to help disabled people into work creating a strong economy for everyone #BattleforNumber10
Difference between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn's answers on Brexit couldn't make the choice for our next PM clearer #BattleforNumber10
Theresa May giving children better opportunities; fall in workless households makes a big difference to their education #BattleforNumber10
It's absolutely right that money should go into the health and social care system rather than on universal WFP #BattleforNumber10
The SNP would rather complain about Westminster politics than use their devolved welfare powers #BattleforNumber10
Crime has fallen by a third since 2010 under Conservative governments #BattleforNumber10
Corbyn's record on the Falklands war shows he's not capable of standing up for Britain #BattleforNumber10
John McDonnell has called for MI5 to be abolished - a vote for anyone but the Conservatives is for Corbyn as PM #BattleforNumber10
Corbyn struggles to remember his manifesto policies on #BattleforNumber10
Labour policy to raise corporation tax would undermine our economic security; higher taxes and fewer jobs #BattleforNumber10
Corbyn 'doesn't want to be held to' his answers on #BattleforNumber10 Not surprising!
Conservative government has led to record employment; Labour policies would lead to fewer jobs for young people #BattleforNumber10
Jeremy Corbyn's views on IRA well documented; he can't answer the question on how to deal with terrorism on #BattleforNumber10

@AlexHoward26 Vote Leave policy is to get out of the Single Market.
There is no saving from leaving because it would damage our economy and therefore cut Government revenue and hit services. @StrongerIn
There are bad ways of controlling immigration and damaging our economy by pulling out of the Single Market is one of the worst. @StrongerIn
Being at the table to fight our cause is better than walking away. @StrongerIn @ConservativesIN

@guyday77 I'm sorry you can't understand the difference between an MP voting in Parliament and all of us voting in a Referendum.
@guyday77 We all have one vote. I have no special privilege as an MP. That is the whole point of a Referendum.
@guyday77 They don't so it's an absurd point. But the real point is that this is not me voting in Parliament, it is a Referendum.
@guyday77 1) 82,000 people will not have one view! 2) would you prefer me not to say what I believe? Most people prefer honest politicians
@guyday77 The democratic process is a Referendum in which we each have one vote.

Helpful meeting with Roads Minister on #OpStack. Government now taking lead to find off-road holding areas to allow M20 to stay open.
@Cally_M2013 When please? No record of this.
Highways England rejection of contraflow on M20 is a typical negative reaction. They have had not a single constructive idea. A shower.

Busy day at Ashford Royal Mail. Five times the number of parcels than in 2011. http://t.co/aMCV9f8ts6
House of Commons computer saying I can't access @Spectator Coffee House blog for security reasons. What on earth are they writing today?

Damian's work in Ashford - http://t.co/kZ9ADu6V4G
@DJSkelton We should be grateful that the left don't want to govern--it's much safer for the country!
Raising threshold for higher rate tax great news for senior teachers etc.
More rate relief for high streets good.
And tax relief for hospices is welcome as well.
Great news from Chancellor about Kent Air Ambulance.
Happy to support the campaign to restrict police bail to 28 days. Too many people kept in limbo for too long.
Great to have confirmation that the full Junction 10A will be built from Transport Secretary.
Took the chance of Education Questions in the Commons to pay tribute to the work of grammar schools.
Ooh! Good stuff #Homeland
@nadinebm123 ok!
Very hopeful about this episode. Last week was great. #Homeland
