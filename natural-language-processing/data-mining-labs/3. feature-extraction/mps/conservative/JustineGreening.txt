Brexit gridlock shows Britain needs a better Parliament, reconnected to communities, working cross party on laws that improve lives. Here‚Äôs my proposal to reform Private Members Bills, shake up the system &amp; bring Parliament closer to people. #makerentcount https://t.co/bL4EI4A1th
....plus let‚Äôs bring back maintenance grants - it would help these young people too. #SocialMobility https://t.co/NPP4Cppnpy
This report is a wake-up call for the HE sector &amp; gvt. We need new ideas, including on student finance to make sure more white, working class students have a fair chance to get into university. Britain can‚Äôt afford talent going to waste. @thesmpledge  https://t.co/gGexFfnZJV
Excellent meeting @fbf_uk this morning &amp; lots of other sectors can learn from what you are doing on #SocialMobility! I‚Äôm looking forward to sharing that through @thesmpledge work. Thanks so much for a great discussion. @coopuk @marksandspencer @PremierFoodsPLC @KPSnacks @Tesco https://t.co/tIIb9raoc3
Great to have the team at @Mazars_UK working with us on the Social Mobility Pledge, some great insights. If you want to join them you can commit your business to taking the pledge here: https://t.co/vQzkXqSmDQ @thesmpledge #SocialMobility https://t.co/X25BcqM44I
Really interesting article that builds on @thesmpledge research - looks at learnings from the legal sector and its use of contextual recruitment to boost #SocialMobility @Rare_London https://t.co/0ZKVgdWs7U
Our ‚Å¶@thesmpledge‚Å© research shows that too many young people think there‚Äôs a class ceiling in Britain. I think they‚Äôre right. Getting on should be about what you know, not who you know. #socialmobility https://t.co/vmnSQjw75T ‚Å¶@jessicaelgot‚Å© https://t.co/vXRjFXKRXv
Great to meet with Richard from @The_HML_Group to discuss #SocialMobility and the work they are doing to open up their industry to people from different backgrounds. @thesmpledge https://t.co/UIBkALn9PB
At @LHRConsultation today in #Roehampton, Heathrow proposing new flight paths for extra flights spread wider across London. Lots of new communities affected by noise. A consultation postcode checker can tell you if a new flight path may be right over you ‚òπÔ∏è. #Putney #Southfields https://t.co/GjWuGzZe7K
I‚Äôm delighted @educationgovuk is steadily delivering on the Social Mobility Action Plan. Teachers in our state schools transformed my own prospects. Our teaching profession deserves a professional &amp; career development approach that‚Äôs world class. #SocialMobility @thesmpledge https://t.co/sGWEkDuBz2
Great news that both @astonmartin and @RollsRoyce have committed to @thesmpledge. They show Britain‚Äôs best business are at the heart of boosting #socialmobility across the UK &amp; key parts of an essential agenda for responsible capitalism in 21st century Britain @andyataston
Great to meet with Patrick and Sarah from @foxtons to discuss what they are already doing to boost diversity and what more we can all do to improve #SocialMobility by working in partnership on @thesmpledge. https://t.co/YZp7H3ve06
We need long term solutions for our country, on student fees &amp; #Brexit. People deserve better than short term political fixes that don‚Äôt work &amp; won‚Äôt last. Time for a new, smarter type of politics, and let‚Äôs bring back maintenance grants while we‚Äôre at it. https://t.co/RFdxjcnDZE
Here's my question to the PM today on how MPs should be honest with the public that broken party politics in Parliament won't find a resolution on Brexit.  #PeoplesVote #Putney https://t.co/0OGHE6ivQj

If you have any information that could help find Hannah please contact @MPSWandsworth.  Her parents are very worried. https://t.co/St5tS8elai
Gvt ministers shouldn‚Äôt give in to mob rule and intimidation and let it dictate gvt policy, they should choose to stand up to it. https://t.co/6hXBhEywPm
Fantastic visit to #Coventry and great to meet everyone @stwater, a key business supporting @thesmpledge and driving #socialmobility in their region. https://t.co/r4WzJQUxQM
@sduport Yes I am and lots of high vis stuff too!
2018 Bike Updateüö≤: So I made it to the end of the year happily still a cyclist, confounding our summer office sweepstake that I wouldn‚Äôt last - I did! I don‚Äôt miss my car, definitely feel fitter, and I‚Äôd recommend giving it a go! #carfree #Putney https://t.co/oEftzhsDw3
Fantastic article on Wentworth Woodhouse being restored by ‚Å¶@Wentworth_House‚Å© volunteers. Remember playing for Rotherham Youth Orchestra in the marble suite. It‚Äôs an amazing place with amazing history, already open for visits. https://t.co/aUwIIuAomT https://t.co/kxD9qgl29B

Fantastic meeting some more wonderful @guidedogs and their owners today at Parliament. Really helpful to talk through the practical issues they face, plus a much needed bit of pet therapy! #AccessAllAreas https://t.co/cknQf61cT9
No way Gvt should force House of Commons on 2 week recess tomorrow - we have no decisions on #Brexit, yet just 100 days to go. Parliament should stay longer, or come back to work like everyone else in first week of January. #KickingTheCan and indecision is no longer an option.
ONS reclassification of student loans is opportunity for ambitious student finance reform. Bring back maintenance grants &amp; scrap existing student debt approach. Need a Graduate Contribution and Higher Education Fund that‚Äôs more progressive and better vfm. https://t.co/UXSESOs0k1
What a great and hugely thoughtful idea that can really help! üåà https://t.co/rbmG9ks9Jc
It‚Äôs now 5 months since my Times article on 16th July first saying Parliament is gridlocked on Brexit. We won‚Äôt tackle the problem if we still don‚Äôt even acknowledge it. Time for decisions from Government and Parliament before Christmas. No more #KickingtheCan down the road. https://t.co/AoasK0HPiS
MPs must be allowed a vote on the PM‚Äôs Brexit deal before Christmas. Delay won‚Äôt change the gridlock in Parliament, but does waste time we don‚Äôt have. Let‚Äôs stop #KickingtheCan down the Brexit road and find a different route through. #PeoplesVoteNow  https://t.co/vwV9XpEQov
It‚Äôs a rainy day in London, but great turnout to support @breastcancernow fundraiser in East #Putney - ¬£30k raised by my near neighbour June to date and still going strong! #Southfields #Roehampton https://t.co/LwCy3JXdqu
@RobertF88713167 @CobblerCare @thesmpledge Great to hear that, we‚Äôre building a coalition of the willing - businesses like yours that want to make a difference on opportunity, and there are lots of you. It‚Äôd be great to have you on board too!  More details on https://t.co/yU0CmZz6Nf.
Delighted that Timpsons @cobblercare has signed up to my #SocialMobilityPledge - we now have businesses covering over 1 million people, all helping to level up opportunity in Britain. Get your business to follow in their footsteps too by signing @thesmpledge #SocialMobility
Parliament #Brexit debate paused but clock still runs down. Delaying Parliament vote on PM Deal till January gets same result but means business uncertainty on investment &amp; wastes crucial time we don‚Äôt have. No vote, No plan B, No progress = No more #KickingtheCan down the road.
Delighted to host the @AoC_info @LondonColleges Christmas Parliamentary reception this evening. Great visit last month to @SouthThamesColl as part of #LoveOurColleges campaign - plays key education role for young people locally across Wandsworth. #Putney #Southfields #Roehampton https://t.co/4iKSR2OyoB
PM now won‚Äôt confirm any date for the promised meaningful vote - it‚Äôs hugely concerning. Parliament has gone round in circles on Brexit. Now today, even that‚Äôs stopped...Britain must find a direction. Kicking the can down the road again solves nothing. #ParliamentNoSayPeopleNoSay https://t.co/hucw0RRDS6
Great morning talking #SocialMobility with students and teachers @Vardeanschool. Awesome visit - thank you!! Now back to the sensible world of Westminster... #GoingRoundInCircles https://t.co/vgJF3PLKaZ

Handed in @Independent petition of over 1m people for a #finalsay on Brexit. There are now clear alternatives facing Britain that will shape our lives for decades. Parliament is gridlocked. Let‚Äôs trust people to make an informed decision on Britain‚Äôs next step. #PeoplesVote https://t.co/3EAHPn5ZBQ
.@SamGyimah recognises #PeoplesVote as a way forward. If Parliament is gridlocked, we have to find another route through for Britain. He made a principled decision to resign which I very much respect - the issues with the Brexit deal that concern him are shared by many MPs. https://t.co/RL3UITQETx
Great #smallbusinesssaturdayuk in #Putney today - supporting local shops &amp; talking to people about how we can have a successful Putney High Street.

Great to be at @londoncouncils conference earlier today with @wesstreeting &amp; Lord Tope. Local councils across #London can lead the way on #socialmobility, working with business.

Very welcome news the Government has today finally seen sense and decided on an earlier introduction on reducing maximum #FOBT stakes. It‚Äôs the right thing to do. Congratulations to campaigners and also ‚Å¶‚Å¶@tracey_crouch‚Å© for standing her ground. https://t.co/fae8i6K6Go
Delighted that @mkcouncil have committed to @thesmpledge! It‚Äôs fantastic to see cross-party support &amp; great to hear about the ideas from @acwalker28 on bringing local businesses on board.

Well done to @JoJohnsonUK on standing up for what he believes in. He was a fantastic Minister to work with whilst we were at the DfE. It‚Äôs a sad loss for Gvt, but Brexit is above party politics. https://t.co/icoTQDF11v
Was a fantastic event - felt a privilege to be part of it! #WomenMPsfTheWorld #Vote100 https://t.co/Dz56EEI8Ls
Insightful ‚Å¶@CommonsEd‚Å© report - good ideas, esp on degree apprenticeships. Fits with my ideas in Feb on reform of student fees - see link below for a way to move off today‚Äôs student debt approach &amp; onto fairer graduate contribution. #valueformoney  https://t.co/UXSESOs0k1
Need a smarter version of politics in Britain for the 21st century, if we‚Äôre to deliver real change on the ground. As part of that @hmtreasury needs to reform for #SocialMobility. https://t.co/I98OTjIjq5
Was great to see everyone and agree #UpliftingImage is about #MakingLifeBetterTogether! https://t.co/K47RKqq7eP
So sad to hear the news just now about Sir Jeremy Heywood - he was a hugely professional and talented civil servant, at a crucial time for our country. My thoughts are with his family.
Sad to see @tracey_crouch having to resign on principle - will be missed in Government but very sure she will be back in the future.
Very pleased to be at @TheStrokeAssoc event this evening supporting their work developing a national plan on stroke as part of the extra investment in our @NHSEnglandLDN. #Putney #Southfields #Roehampton https://t.co/CbZ62pucWA
Great @hmtreasury has new ¬£675m Future High Streets Fund &amp; cut in business rates for smaller properties - both can help #Putney High Street and shops, pubs &amp; restaurants in #Southfields &amp; #Roehampton too. Thks for the shout out too @PhilipHammondUK on my lobbying! #Budget2018
Great to see everyone outside East Putney station at the #PoppyAppeal today - hope @AhmadiyyaUK @AMEA_UK raise lots of funds for @PoppyLegion and best wishes for the rest of your fundraising for such an important cause. https://t.co/ANYV1giD0D

@gweccles The HMT reading room was not busy when I went (three times) to properly go through the material. It‚Äôs in the public domain now but I‚Äôd recommend reading it to anyone - it gives a regional and sectoral split, amongst other analysis.

I‚Äôm delighted that @AcurisGlobal is backing @thesmpledge - great to have on board and also to meet up today to talk about the challenges and opportunities to do more on #socialmobility. Fantastic to have so much support. https://t.co/BH4O9lBc9C
Thank you @AllenOvery for committing to @thesmpledge. It was excellent to hear about your work on #socialmobility and the many steps your organisation is taking to find talent wherever it is! #rightthingsmartthing https://t.co/oOfJJW8d5s
Great getting chance to meet @TrentUni Deputy VC today to discuss their work on social mobility and @thesmpledge #socialmobility https://t.co/BPLdMiFBF2
Having read the detail, this deal is a fudge. It‚Äôs the worst of both worlds. Time to take the decision out of the hands of stalemated politicians and give it back to the people to decide. #Chequersdeal  https://t.co/xTh2Yj3LYn
Hope @GarethSouthgate and @England can at least enjoy his favourite local @YoungsPubs bitter that has been sent over to Moscow by our Wandsworth @YoungsBeer. Great manager and brilliant job. #EnglandvsCroatia

Positive response back from Chris Grayling to my question in Commons Transport questions about @transportgovuk support for a second entrance at Putney Station - much needed by everyone. Already has the backing of @wandbc too! #putney #putneystation
On my Commons question re keeping existing 480k flights cap on existing runways, Grayling said he‚Äôd had no proposals asking him to change. I‚Äôm sure it was reported @HeathrowAirport wanted him to lift it. Maybe they‚Äôll confirm whether or not they want the cap to stay. @GregHands https://t.co/KOamiY6T1V

Not surprised at third runway vote tonight, #Heathrow lobby is powerful one, but I‚Äôll continue to represent my community‚Äôs concerns. Thanks for the support from everyone! In the end the evidence will win out. Appalling Parliament only had 4 hrs to debate such an important issue.
Great you‚Äôre back Greg! I wouldn‚Äôt want any long term MP campaigners against #Heathrow expansion to miss their chance to represent their community. #commitment #bulldozer https://t.co/FP5h4lqrAg
That was a fantastic @england team performance in really tough, hot conditions. Not sure how to deal with this new experience of an easy, massive England win but I think I‚Äôll cope! #WorldCupRussia2018
This ‚Å¶@FT‚Å© article on #HeathrowExpansion financing should give MPs voting on Monday a wake up call. No wonder Heathrow Airport Ltd had poison pill cost recovery clause to pass the risk to taxpayers. ‚Å¶@trussliz‚Å© ‚Å¶@hmtreasury‚Å© #headinsand https://t.co/fgagB1PhpT
@helenpidd @NEEChamber .....and per DfT ‚Äútotal benefits to passengers and wider economy‚Äù stronger with Gatwick than Heathrow, Tble 3.1, p10 ‚ÄúAddendum to Updated Appraisal Report‚Äù,  Fig 3.1 p11 shows Heathrow way more risky. Heathrow is worse project for Nth-East, UK &amp; pssngrs. Odd DfT ignores own data.
@helenpidd @NEEChamber Wonder if DfT or Heathrow ever flagged up that there will be 4,000 fewer north-east international flights annually at Newcastle airport by 2030, 14% fewer than otherwise. Bad for regional investment not good....
It‚Äôs wrong @GregHands had to resign purely for being consistent in representing local community concerns on #Heathrow over the years. Government unnecessarily lost a great Minister, when instead we could have had a free vote. If @transportgovuk convinced of its case, why not?
Great news Greg! Lots of MPs will worry about costs, pollution, safety and regional impact. Would be sensible if PM could allow Conservative MPs a free vote on #Heathrow expansion. https://t.co/14R1MfNzeM
Correct. Newquay-Heathrow route will be even more uneconomic and unviable than now, post expansion. #fantasyairporteconomics where domestic routes get more viable when Heathrow gets more expensive. https://t.co/bOG9f8RPmA
Our research shows why @thesmpledge‚Å© is needed - grassroots action by business to improve opportunity &amp; #SocialMobility. We can‚Äôt have a class ceiling in Britain, we deserve equality of opportunity wherever people are, whatever their background.  https://t.co/ZAQxOZI7pc
Very good news on @Morrisons also now committing to @thesmpledge. Delighted that one of my old employees has come on board. I learnt a lot being part of the team in the @Morrisons store years ago in Rotherham!
#NorthernFail commuters: Commons vote nxt week on spending huge ¬£10-15bn of public transport money for #Heathrow Airport Ltd‚Äôs expansion. Is your MP voting for this? Means less money for public transport across UK, plus hurts regional airports &amp; hurts environment. @AndyBurnhamGM
Phew. That‚Äôs a relief. Like this happy ending stuff @England!
It‚Äôs fantastic to be able to announce that @Tesco are committing to @thesmpledge - really great news! Tempted to say ‚Äòevery little helps‚Äô but they are pretty big...#socialmobility
PM is right to be putting in place a 5yr budget deal for the #NHS which will mean an increase by over ¬£20 billion a year in real terms by 2023-24. Longer term planning is a much more sensible approach.
Delighted to have @PenguinUKBooks support for @thesmpledge to boost #SocialMobility across the UK. It‚Äôs fantastic that so many companies are stepping up to help. Thank you! #LevelledupBritain
Local communities remember a strict planning condition of the fifth terminal go ahead years ago.....there‚Äôd be no third runway. So this is a meaningless promise from increasingly desperate DfT. #heathrowexpansion #environmentmatters  https://t.co/mCIlHPMdDW

Great news to have @BP_plc committing to @thesmpledge - another business that can help give more opportunities to more young people. Thanks for getting on board! #SocialMobility
It‚Äôs v frustrating Chris Chope‚Äôs main efforts seem to be to stop other MPs across the House of Commons achieving their positive, often cross party and @Conservatives supported campaigns, including the upskirting legislation. Hope he changes his tune to start supporting.

@JohnJCrace I know!
‚ÄúNobody puts baby in a corner‚Äù @johnjcrace https://t.co/zkYttRPpos
So it turns out @transportgovuk only gave poison pill cost recovery clause to #Heathrow Airport Limited and not others.  Why? Could cost taxpayers billions. Totally irresponsible and naive to unnecessarily expose UK public to this financial risk. @ZacGoldsmith @AdamAfriyie https://t.co/xw3mopHBMV
Those boots by @BrandlehowSch and Hurlingham children were great - wellies and flowers definitely go together! Count me in for next year!#TheGreatWellieCompetition #bootiful https://t.co/O0QASLwmjA
This is the cost recovery clause Heathrow Airport Limited agreed with @transportgov. It‚Äôs an ¬£18bn project - why is taxpayers‚Äô money put at risk for failed #Heathrow. #Putney #London @ZacGoldsmith https://t.co/ywCbD69MsO
Heathrow third runway is a bad deal for my community and for our country. It‚Äôs expensive &amp; polluting. We need a 21st century UK airports strategy - regional airports with more connectivity on people‚Äôs doorsteps and helping regional economic growth. #Heathrow #Putney #London
Remembering the #LondonBridge attacks - thoughts with those killed and injured. Terrorism will never divide our city. #LondonTogether

Great interview from @jordanhenderson just now. Tough time tonight but @LFC did us proud and had huge heart. @DavidWooding - sorry it didn‚Äôt work out but that @GarethBale11 goal was certainly special.
Just watched @GarethBale11 being interviewed and the whole time no @realmadrid players come over to congratulate him for scoring two amazing winning goals. Unbelievable. He just won that trophy for them. Hope he‚Äôs back in @premierleague next season!
......however I‚Äôm sure @loriskarius will want to forget @GarethBale11 forever. Still feel that @SergioRamos got off far too lightly for a tackle that put @MoSalah out of the #ChampionsLeagueFinal2018.
Nothing anyone can do about that goal from @GarethBale11. Still unbelievable watching the replays.
Awesome goal from @sadiomane10. @lfc is no way a one man team. It‚Äôs game on now.
@joemccormick92 @MoSalah @LFC @JurgenOfficial Indeed! Bottom line is that @lfc need to now prove they can win without @MoSalah and I think they can.
Gutted to see @MoSalah out of the match (this feels like watching an England match) - but if anyone can give a half time team talk to win this second half #ChampionsLeagueFinal2018 for @lfc it has to be @JurgenOfficial. Fingers crossed.
By the way, I know Joe Hart may be disappointed he‚Äôs not in our 2018 World Cup squad, but must admit I won‚Äôt miss those hair shampoo ads...
Right, think this is going to be an amazing #ChampionsLeagueFinal2018. Thinking of you @DavidWooding! Come on @LFC!
Looks like a historic and welcome vote to #RepealThe8th following the #Referendum in Ireland. Congratulations to all those who campaigned successfully for change.  Your voices are finally heard and will make a difference for generations to come.

@Sherelle_E_J Contextual recruitment is already used by all the major law firms in London since 2015. It‚Äôs common sense and good business sense. Means they‚Äôre 50% more likely to hire bright students from disadvantaged backgrounds too. I think that‚Äôs a good thing.
Talent is spread evenly across our country - the smartest British businesses are already using contextual recruitment to help them find it. More opportunity is good news for our young people, and good for Britain.  @thesmpledge #LevelledupBritain https://t.co/mTs81TRMdH

Totally right call by PM. Assad signed the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2013 and said he had destroyed his stockpile, with Russia as guarantor of that. They have no respect for international laws or human rights, and want to make them inoperable by breaching with impunity. https://t.co/XQCbtXnonq

Tim Farron spent the evening arguing with his would-be coalition of chaos partners, Labour, SNP, Greens. What a mess it would be. #bbcDebate
Corbyn's own MPs told him to go, candidates won't put him on election leaflets - if they won't have him, why should the country? #bbcDebate
More arguing between the coalition of chaos -Lab/Lib/Green, less a progressive alliance, more a backwards step. #BBCdebate
IFS said black hole on Labour tuition fees costings, and on childcare too. #bbcdebate
Corbyn, Libs, SNP arguing, gives us early sight of what their coalition of chaos will be like. No plan on Brexit, as can't agree. #BBCdebate
Labour always spend more, borrow more, the real budget they raise is debt interest = less money for public services, not more. #bbcdebate
2.8m jobs created since 2010 by businesses that Corbyn and the Greens want to tax - incl SMEs, the backbone of our economy. #bbcdebate
Labour left youth unemployment up by nearly 50%. No plan for Brexit, a Lab/Lib/SNP coalition of chaos and tax rises, to take UK backwards.
Corbyn's coalition of chaos will wreck our economy with highest tax burden for years #bbcdebate

Under @theresa_may as Home Sec crime down by 1/3 since 2010. Or we can have Diane Abbott as Home Sec, Corbyn as PM w Labour #BattleForNo10
Corbyn wants to hammer small companies who create jobs with extra taxes. Labour's learnt nothing after crashing economy. #BattleForNo10
Corbyn's manifesto wld run UK economy into ground. I was in 2010 Treasury Team that found note "there's no money left". Labour = no jobs.

Very sad to see PM announce he is standing down, a dignified, heartfelt statement to the British people.
Brexit is not what many young people voted for. All the more important that UK outside EU still delivers for them on jobs &amp; opportunities.
#EUref result was not one I wanted but hope lasting legacy will be that a new generation of young voters took their place in our democracy
This isn't the path I wanted Britain to take but we need to respect the result &amp; do our best to confront the challenges brexit now brings
Historic referendum vote is over, I'm proud a Conservative gvt gave British people their say. Now time for our party to come back together.
