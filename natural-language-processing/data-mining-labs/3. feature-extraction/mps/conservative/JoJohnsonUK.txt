The Times view on the Brexit impasse: Theresa May should allow MPs to vote promptly on her deal | Comment | The Times https://t.co/fU8yXcZMnM
Parliament should be allowed to get on with it and vote on the PM's deal before Christmas. It's not going to improve with a few tweaks and assurances. It's fundamentally flawed. Persisting with it is burning up valuable time. Delaying vote til mid January totally unacceptable.
Persisting with this hopeless endeavour is irresponsible - Bloomberg editorial view is that it‚Äôs time to ‚Äúlet the people decide‚Äù https://t.co/nL4ffQVwUt

@His_Grace Under charity law, institutions also have a duty to have a code of practice which covers the activities and appropriate governance of student unions. They must also draw students' attention to the institutions' free speech code of practice at least once a year.
@His_Grace Hang on - crucial point is that the freedom of speech duty in 1986 Education no2 Act (extended in HERA 2017) covers both the premises of the university and premises occupied by the students unions, even when they're not part of university premises (section 43 (8)).
