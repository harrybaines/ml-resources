Arrived in Copenhagen to see @anderssamuelsen on second leg of trip to Europe this week. Beyond Brexit, Denmark are an important partner and we work really closely on global issues from Iran to Ukraine. Proud to have them as allies 🇬🇧🇩🇰 https://t.co/wVyfw0wpCM
Worthwhile bilateral meetings with foreign ministers of 🇮🇪 🇧🇪 🇵🇹 🇫🇮 🇪🇸&amp; 🇸🇪 to stress a) parliament will deliver majority for modified deal b) UK commitment to NI peace process absolute. This can be done... https://t.co/QWIhS2BSRn
Good progress made by Yemeni parties on plan for redeployment of troops from Hodeidah. Agreement must be swiftly finalised &amp; implemented. Crucial that parties also engage constructively in discussions on prisoner exchange to build confidence https://t.co/Y8C4iihAFU

My update on Yemen after talks with partners in Warsaw yesterday evening https://t.co/tUQaL5iIxJ
Today in Warsaw will shortly host  Quad 🇬🇧🇺🇸 🇸🇦 🇦🇪 Foreign Ministers’ meeting on Yemen. Window of opportunity to turn UN-brokered ceasefire into a peace process is shortening. For the first time clear a solution IS possible but we urgently need more momentum from the two sides https://t.co/JyEMccVUmS
Catching up with DPM of Romania @AnaBirchall today in Warsaw. Both agreed we need to work together to make progress on Brexit and the backstop, while making sure 🇬🇧🇷🇴 relationship continues to thrive https://t.co/uZqNATu0kL

Great to meet my colleague and good friend FM #Czaputowicz in Warsaw this morning @PolandMFA.

Admirable candour on China from @emilythornberry but WRONG to 2 suggest we don’t prioritise human rights: media freedom &amp; freedom of religious belief campaigns; work to release prisoners in Iran/UAE, brilliant work done by UK diplomats @tariqahmadbtz @JoannaRoperFCO &amp; many others
Lab can put our minds at rest by recognising Juan Guaido (from Lab’s sister party!) alongside not just US but Canada, France, Germany, Columbia, Peru and Ecuador otherwise your speech is just words, albeit sensible ones
Thank you @EmilyThornberry for speaking sensibly on Venezuela and also the use of sanctions – but would Lab policy be decided by you or @jeremycorbyn who says exactly the opposite?
Next week I’ll be meeting with US, UAE &amp; Saudi Arabia foreign ministers to help do that. It would be totally tragic for the people of Yemen if we start to slip back into conflict 2/2

Happy Chinese New Year to all those celebrating around the world!   新春快乐 ，猪年大吉!  #YearOfThePig https://t.co/qgu3L7F6iA
Nicolas Maduro has not called Presidential elections within 8 day limit we have set. So UK alongside European allies now recognises @jguaido as interim constitutional president until credible elections can be held. Let’s hope this takes us closer to ending humanitarian crisis
@jeremycorbyn Venezuela is not another Iraq but about whether we support a democrat from Labour’s sister party @jguaido who is trying to end poverty and destitution through instituting free and fair elections. Those kind of things used to matter to the Labour Party...
@JosepBorrellF Thank you for this generous comment Josep it has been a great pleasure working with you and your colleagues and I am sure our excellent collaboration will continue post Brexit
Totally agree with the US decision. Russia has an opportunity to choose a different path over the next 6 months, but if Moscow chooses to keep undermining the international rules based system, UK &amp; allies are clear that Russia alone is responsible for the demise of the #INFTreaty https://t.co/fQGlJLj4zu

Wonder how proud @jeremycorbyn is of ringing Nicolas Maduro on live TV to congratulate him on his victory? If Maduro’s policies result in 82% of population in poverty there is just the tiniest clue what Corbyn’s policies might do to Britain...
2/2 @jguaido is the right person to take Venezuela forward. If there are not fresh &amp; fair elections announced within 8 days UK will recognise him as interim President to take forward the political process towards democracy. Time for a new start for the suffering ppl of Venezuela
1/2 After banning opposition candidates, ballot box stuffing and counting irregularities in a deeply flawed election it is clear Nicolas Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela
Absolutely right Gary https://t.co/2Hxl9D9qah

Today I summoned the Iranian Ambassador to demand Nazanin has immediate access to the healthcare she requires. Her ongoing detention is TOTALLY unacceptable and her treatment at the hands of Iranian authorities is a fundamental breach of human rights 1/2

.@pressfreedom reports that 251 journalists have been jailed in 2018, 18% of them without charge. Without a free media to hold politicians to account democracy cannot function. #PressFreedom https://t.co/iqBRN4N20y
.@TIME absolutely right to recognise the #Guardians and the vital role journalists play as the lifeblood of democracy. #TIMEPOY  Media freedom and the protection of journalists is key to a free society. #pressfreedom #journalismNotACrime
Thanks @savechildrenuk: your report on the number of children dying from starvation in Yemen shook the world - and the participants - into action. https://t.co/QXN6xaSzJ6
Heartening to see positive outcomes of Yemen talks, including ceasefire and withdrawal of troops in Hodeidah. Taking steps towards peace required courage from both delegations - now we need to build a lasting settlement and stop people dying
The case of the two Reuters journalists imprisoned for exposing the Rohingya crisis sends a chilling message. Journalism must never be a crime, as I discussed with Amal Clooney who is doing a great job representing Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo https://t.co/P9QQDDIcu1

My message from #Yemen peace talks in Stockholm https://t.co/GbB3imL0hm
Dialogue is key to achieving peace in Yemen. At the talks in Sweden today I met with the Government of Yemen and the Houthi delegations to stress the need for all sides to continue to work towards a political solution https://t.co/skizVbAfYc
Yemen peace talks today in Stockholm show @UN diplomacy at its best. Great to see UN Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths @OSE_Yemen here today to discuss how the UK can bolster the work UN is doing to achieve a lasting peace settlement
Huge congrats to @theresa_may whose stamina, resilience and decency has again won the day and given her the chance to deliver Brexit for our country
Beyond Brexit, talks continue in Stockholm over the conflict in Yemen. Just spoke to @SecPompeo about what more our two countries can do to support peace. We are both 100% behind the work of @OSE_Yemen . Watch this space
My sincere request to colleagues: BREXIT IS NOT GUARANTEED and the British people will not forgive us if we fail to deliver it. All those who want to stop it are praying for a Conservative leadership contest. So don’t take the risk and back @theresa_may tonight
I am backing @theresa_may tonight. Being PM most difficult job imaginable right now and the last thing the country needs is a damaging and long leadership contest. Brexit was never going to be easy but she is the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March 29
International collaboration crucial to secure justice for the atrocities in Rakhine. Last week French Foreign Minister @JY_LeDrian &amp; I sent a joint letter to Aung San Suu Kyi to set out where there must be urgent progress if the Rohingya are to return home safely and with dignity https://t.co/SQeNBETB0L
Congratulations to @LouiseElisabet for winning @pressgazette Marie Colvin award for her work on Syria. She has been drawing the world’s attention to the human cost of the war in Syria at a time where good quality journalism has never been more important. Richly deserved. #BJA2018

Just back from Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels where whatever the challenges (including spoof twitter accounts) Sir Tim Barrow @ukineu does a great job as our Ambassador to the EU!

Welcome home Matt Hedges! The whole country is relieved and delighted to have you home. Thanks to @PatrickMoodyFCO and the FCO team in UAE for your tireless work behind the scenes to make today possible
Today I was honoured to attend an exhibition on the Holodomor – a deeply disturbing chapter in history. As a deliberate act of 1932-33 Soviet policy millions of Ukrainians were starved to death. They will never be forgotten. https://t.co/qFGnGyQ01b

The UK utterly condemns Russia's use of force against Ukrainian vessels entering the Sea of Azov. Once again, we see Russian CONTEMPT for international norms and Ukrainian sovereignty. Russia must release detained Ukrainian sailors and guarantee free passage through Kerch Straits
Fantastic news about Matthew Hedges.Although we didn’t agree with charges we are grateful to UAE govt for resolving issue speedily.But also a bittersweet moment as we remember Nazanin &amp;other innocent ppl detained in Iran.Justice won’t be truly done until they too are safely home.

Today I saw Matthew Hedges' wife Daniela &amp; UAE Ambassador. I've just had a constructive conversation with UAE FM Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed. I believe &amp; trust he's working hard to resolve the situation asap. We've a close partnership with UAE which will help us take things forward
Our thoughts are with Matthew Hedges, his wife Daniela and his family today. We will do everything we can to get him home as soon as possible https://t.co/hE4systClL
The situation in Yemen has to change.   Aim of UK sponsored UN Security Council resolution is to relieve the immediate humanitarian crisis and maximise the chances of achieving a political settlement https://t.co/QbTeIRiP6v
News on Matthew Hedges extremely worrying. We have seen no evidence to back up charges against him. FCO will do ALL we can to get him home &amp; I will meet his wife Daniela tmrw. UAE claim to be friend &amp; ally of the UK so there will be serious diplomatic consequences. Unacceptable.
Congratulations to South Korea's Kim Jong-yang on election as President of Interpol. Very important news for rule of law internationally and encouraging that in a secret ballot this was so widely recognised

I met King Salman and Foreign Minister @AdelAljubeir this morning, and will see the Crown Prince as well as UAE and Yemeni politicians this afternoon. We have been discussing #Khashoggi but also the vital need to seize the moment in Yemen and stop famine and cholera intensifying https://t.co/n4fFQfUUkj
I am in Saudi Arabia and the UAE today because there is a short window to make a difference. All sides need to get behind both the UN peace process led by Martin Griffiths @OSE_Yemen and current UK efforts in the Security Council
Right now we are witnessing a man-made humanitarian catastrophe in #Yemen. 75% of the population require humanitarian assistance and 8.4m are at risk of starvation - we desperately need a breakthrough

Illegal wildlife trade is a huge transnational crime. Killing 20,000 elephants and 1,400 rhinos annually, IWT funds global criminal enterprises. I’m proud we are hosting the largest ever conference to #EndWildlifeCrime today in London with HRH the Duke of Cambridge https://t.co/InET0jH59A

Just met the Saudi ambassador to seek urgent answers over Jamal Khashoggi. Violence against journalists worldwide is going up &amp; is a grave threat to freedom of expression. If media reports prove correct, we will treat the incident seriously - friendships depend on shared values.
Incredibly moved to see ‘Nazanin’s Story’ last night. Huge credit to the producers, cast &amp; Richard Ratcliffe for bringing to life just how much this extraordinarily brave family have been through. All the more reason to continue the battle to bring Nazanin home. #freenazanin https://t.co/Qdk9Q1jarP

Reflections on my first #UNGA as 🇬🇧 Foreign Secretary https://t.co/6e4aeQzcWM

In a word, history. Russia feels threatened by Europe - but they are wrong. If they start following the rules everyone else does they will get the respect they crave - but if they choose their current path they will only isolate themselves even more https://t.co/Pm2aL2tGDO
Hi Fleur - you’re right that dealing with Yemen’s humanitarian catastrophe is the priority, so UK has provided £570m+ since 2015 to help. Today at #UNGA I’ll host a meeting with US/Saudi/Emirati ministers - the key is a political process, it can’t be solved militarily https://t.co/HsNrChslWV
Hi David. You’re absolutely right that we should do more by Skype. But you also need to build trust, so face to face diplomacy, particularly when you meet for the first time, will always be an important part of international relations.

@MartinBromiley This means a lot coming from you. You’ve achieved so much on patient safety - I’ll never forget your insights on human factors. It’s been a total privilege to work with you.
@JamesTitcombe Thanks so much James. Meeting you all those years ago was a game-changer for me. Still full of awe and respect for the way you turned tragedy into a fearless campaign for safer care for everyone. Please stay in touch.
Couldn’t ask for a better successor than @matthancock to take forward long term NHS plan with his brilliant understanding of the power of technology. The new NHS app will be in safe hands!
Massive wrench for me to leave health - I know some staff haven’t found me the easiest Health Sec but the NHS, and particularly patient safety, has become my passion &amp; it really was the greatest privilege of my life to serve for so many years
Huge honour to be appointed Foreign Secretary at this critical moment in our country’s history. Time to back our PM to get a great Brexit deal - it's now or never...
@OllyStokoe I’m a great fan of yours too Olly
On other days we can debate next steps and how we improve to get the best outcomes in Europe . But today we should stop and take note of the reason the NHS is still, despite all its challenges, our most popular national institution - which in two words is ITS PEOPLE!
The NHS was only the sixth universal health system globally but has come to symbolise one of the greatest advances of humanity: no matter who you are, rich or poor, young or old, in a civilised country you'll always be able to access good healthcare. Long may that continue.
Happy birthday NHS. And thank you for being there for me and my family (3 gorgeous kids) as well as for a staggering one million people every 17 hours.

Surely the right answer to this is not to disparage the values the NHS stands for but to challenge it to live up to them BETTER e.g. by delivering the best health outcomes in the world (like in cancer where we don’t) as well as the fairest access: https://t.co/3pRU1K5M6G

Staff @RNOHNHS have not one, not two, but THREE freedom to speak up guardians who they can turn to if they need to highlight concerns over care. Excellent to see such an open &amp; honest culture that will lead to safer care.
An NHS first @LNWH_NHS ! Innovative staff introduced bilingual labels on medication so patients are in no doubt about how to take their meds safely. Fantastic work that I hope the rest of the NHS can learn from.
Wycombe Hospital @Buckshealthcare was one of the first trusts to go into special measures and one of the first to come out. Good to hear about their progress on patient safety, especially medical examiners.
Sad to hear fantastic @LesleyDwyerMFT is moving on – she has given hope not just to @Medway_NHS_FT but to whole NHS through her inspiring leadership. Good luck down under!
Privileged to be able to thank some of the staff @CLCHNHSTrust who helped deal with the Grenfell tragedy last year. The NHS at its best - providing expert care in the most challenging of circumstances

This is classic. The biggest single boost to funding NHS history and someone still manages to find a reason why it is a secret privatisation plot... https://t.co/nJ8x5WhNIa
As PM says part of deal will be real focus on productivity, efficiency and tackling waste. No health care system anywhere in the world will have 'enough' in the face of the demographic challenges we all face so every penny saved will go back into higher quality care for patients.
I hope will give NHS staff hope that really impressive progress on safety/quality (incl 2.1 million more patients using good/outstanding hosps) will now be sustained. Achieving that during a financial squeeze has been nothing short of miraculous - now we can make change permanent
V proud of the NHS - but today esp proud of PM who made clear NHS is #1 priority.Package won't mean pressures vanish overnight but does secure future of NHS with for first time stable 5 yr funding backed by 10 yr plan which as NHS leaders say allows real prog on cancer&amp; ment hlth

Looking forward, massively welcome that PM backs long term funding stability. But we need 2 more things to secure our spot as safest&amp;best: a) reform that moves care models to prevention b) grasping potential of tech 2 transform health as it has every other aspect of life.Onwards!
Also been privilege 2 work with many including  @normanlamb @JackieDP @timkendall1 to improve mental health &amp; @JeremyHughesAlz &amp; others on dementia.But we still need waiting times standards for ALL conditions &amp; more consistent care for those living with dementia so work continues
Proud to have worked with @MartinBromiley @amotherwithout @sams_monkey @JamesTitcombe @DebHazeldine @curetheNHS &amp; others to make progress on safety although much more to do: still too much avoidable harm, blame culture not yet eradicated and we need to address #bawagarba issues
Some have asked what are biggest things I wish I had known when I started: too many to list, but top are a) importance of detailed workforce planning b) critical link between NHS &amp; social care and c) if u want to improve patient safety there is no change without culture change
James has turned tragedy into a mission to make care safer for everyone, one of the biggest inspirations in my 5 years as Health Sec https://t.co/LoH2guRORp
Sometimes time has flown, at others it’s been achingly slow, but every second of last 5+ yrs has been a privilege. Thanks #NHS for being extraordinary in so many ways: much more impressive than a long serving Health Sec are the staff who have devoted 10, 15 or 20+ yrs to patients
From emergency care nurse to CNO @JaneMCummings has made huge differences for NHS staff and patients for 40 years. She will be greatly missed but continue to contribute as NHSI/E bring top nursing role together.
Huge congratulations to all staff @Ldn_Ambulance today as they exit special measures. Service faces huge pressures but commitment to Londoners is inspirational.

Use of outsourcing by the NHS flat in Conservative-run England but going up in Labour-run Wales - just shows this is a transparent attempt to scare the public rather than engage in a rational debate about what is best for patients. NHS staff deserve better...#PMQs
Whole Cabinet now joins 2.4m Brits as @DementiaFriends after Cabinet today. Saw v moving Barbara's Story presented by Eileen Sills @GSTTnhs. @JeremyHughesAlz showed us how tough even making tea can be for those living with dementia. Thanks @Theresa_may for leading from the top
SWARM - not just another NHS acronym - instead a way for staff @royalhospital to take action after an incident to ensure learning happens immediately. Excellent safety initiative.
Many young patients @Sheffchildrens are now cared for in their own individual rooms - which is great for privacy and dignity but how do nurses keep tabs on patients?  https://t.co/oJUYehMUye
ZERO can be an off-putting word in mental health, but @SHSCFT has not shied away. Their achievement of zero use of prone restraint is an incredible achievement that must be shared with others across the NHS
Honoured to have @jomartin_path speak to staff @SheffieldHosp with me today - an open and honest discussion about the importance of sharing and learning from clinical mistakes.
Thanks for the warm Yorkshire welcome @rdash_nhs as I marked my 100th patient safety visit across the NHS today. Looking forward to uncovering and sharing more best practice across the system.
Hard-hitting NMC report shows why safety is not just about performance but culture too: if an org doesn't listen to families then we won’t learn from mistakes.And learning is the only real apology bereaved families want. NHS has made progress but today shows sadly much more to do

Devastated to hear we have lost @TessaJowell. She was quite simply the bravest and the best &amp; brought magic to whatever she touched whether SureStarts, London 2012 or campaigning for those who like her were battling with incurable cancer. RIP
Its international nurses day so I want to pay tribute to all our amazing NHS nurses. Their skill &amp; compassion is one of the main reasons that the NHS remains the thing that makes us most proud to be British. I know you’ve never worked harder - thank you so much for all you do.
@jones_celia @KeeleyMP So sorry to hear about yr partner but afraid the Royal Gwent is the responsibility of the Welsh Labour govt and not me. Good luck getting to the bottom of what happened
@HughFW @BBCOne Mmm might just have to tune in then...
Far poorer outcomes for people with learning disabilities have got to be addressed, which is why we set up the learning from deaths programme. Now all deaths of people with learning disabilities are reviewed properly - agree with all recommendations of last week’s Bristol report.
Why the independent health sector should be just as transparent as the NHS on patient safety – and the NHS needs to be paid back if they have to pay the price for mistakes in private care https://t.co/GuTYbOANWM
.@Epsom_StHelier shows exactly how being open &amp; learning from incidents helps patients - they embed data from serious incidents into high tech simulation &amp; crisis training scenarios, helping staff to lower the mortality rate at the trust to half the national average.
Great to be back at Springfield @SWLSTG 3 years on from my shift on their Aquarius ward. Real progress being made on improving patient safety. https://t.co/v7oyGFr0MK
Inspiring talk by @matthewsyed on patient safety@stgeorge's. Also great effort and determination from staff to get out of special measures.
My thoughts today with the thousands of women and families affected by failures in our breast cancer screening programme. We will get to the bottom of this so we can stop it happening again.
Devastating news for all of us lucky enough to serve with @AmberRuddHR. In cabinet she was always a true statesman who spoke her mind publicly and privately irrespective of the politics. She will be missed until she is back which she will be!
Thanks @RUHBath for showing me impressive outcomes on your drive to eliminate avoidable pressure ulcers and treat sepsis - always good to see outcomes driven by reliable data
A rousing welcome both inside and out @Glos_CareNHS this afternoon! Delighted to congratulate staff in person for their Good rating from @CareQualityComm and welcome new CEO Paul Roberts to the role
Great visualisation of the patient safety improvements made by staff @WyeValleyNHS since entering special measures in 2014 and exiting in 2016 - but almost 2 years old now - look forward to seeing more progress when @CareQualityComm returns https://t.co/aMExkVr42B
New tech is bringing radical change to medicine. Listen to the brilliant @erictopol on what this means for patients – his review will be crucial for building a future-fit NHS #NHS70 https://t.co/zVdDZBuGFM
To the rest of the NHS: take notice of @WestSuffolkNHS for their fantastic work on the learning from deaths programme - already being used as a blueprint &amp; replicated elsewhere. Thanks for an excellent visit today &amp; lively discussion with staff. https://t.co/D8HZ0I2kf3

Despite achieving 0 recorded C-diff or MRSA infections among over 700k eye patients seen in 16/17, @Moorfields continues to strive further for patient safety - inviting in the @HsafetyIB to help improve. Admirable, proactive approach.
Great welcome by 7yr old Shiloh @greatormondst. They know staff are key to improving safety, recruiting 18 safety champions + putting 70% of patients on sepsis 6 pathway within an hr of condition deteriorating. https://t.co/jkDfwZn8G9

Being able to register a baby’s death after miscarriage/stillbirth before 24 weeks could bring comfort in the face of extraordinary grief. Delighted @ClarkCoates &amp; @collinge1717 will now lead review into how we change this, while also improving wider package of support across NHS
Huge congratulations to all the staff @NHSHarlow for exiting special measures. https://t.co/KPlfL0dKqB
Congrats to @EveningStandard for doing this. Crisis in America heading our way unless we act... https://t.co/CBl27QeP3U
@helen63lambert @craig4nwarks They haven't. Mandate is clear we will make measurable progress towards hitting both A &amp; E and RTT targets next year...despite the pressures (and an NHS doing 6,000 more operations every day since 2010) we don't want 2 go back to the bad old days of permanently long waiting lists
Delighted to confirm pay rise of between 6.5 and 29% for NHS staff who have worked so hard over a tough Winter, in a £4.2bn deal. Rarely has a pay rise been more deserved.

#BawaGarba shows the importance of peer support so good to see what is happening @Nottmhospitals where 20 staff were trained in peer support yesterday
Calling all clinicians, patients and anyone else interested... Please share your thoughts on the lessons we need to learn from #BawaGarba to the Williams review: https://t.co/9kLQpCEgPI
One of the more encouraging things beginning to happen in the NHS is great leaders spreading their wings. Well done @LesleyWattsCEO and team for doing a great job @ChelwestFT
Probing questions from staff @RBandH this morning where we had a lively debate on NHS workforce and pay. Thanks for visit, delighted to join you during your clinical governance day to see peer review and learning from deaths in action
Stephen Hawking was a defining force in the world of science whose loss will be felt in every corner of the globe. I was sad that we didn’t agree on everything, but he was still a hero to me as one of our greatest ever thinkers - he inspired with his courage as well as his words.
We talk a lot about changing models of care to deal with an ageing population, much less about the inventions and tech transformations that will probably save our skin in the end. Hence this new £300m fund to attract innovation on healthy ageing from all over the world https://t.co/IpFLDWqR8X
Many inspirational female leaders already in healthcare, but fair to say the NHS still has more to do to open up opportunities for women at all levels: @hcwomensleaders network is important agent for change &amp; deserves MUCH more than 3,700 followers… #NHSwomen #pressforprogress https://t.co/cU88pLHfPs
Impressive determination from @NHSBartsHealth to make their care even safer - half the number of never events since 2015 shows their huge focus on learning lessons and supporting staff to speak out when concerned is working https://t.co/aBvyXKM5aH
Really useful discussion at #CNOSummit. Resolving workforce pressures vital for patient safety https://t.co/ATYe3K4pWl
@vaughan_jenny @gmc @cpsuk @gmcuk @doctor_oxford @doctorcaldwell @djnicholl @DacreJane @RCSnews Exactly. Which is why we need real reform to make sure this doesn't happen again. If we don't the consequences for patient safety will be disastrous
So far this year 4600 concerns have been raised with the new Freedom to Speak Up Guardians and 90% say they would do it again – shows the new role is working. Good idea from Robert Francis.
7% increase in 5 yrs in NHS staff recommending their own organisation's care to friends and family, but still much more to do to give staff confidence they can speak up when things are going wrong #ftsu https://t.co/gSKqZU6tK8

.@lptnhs delivering some brilliant innovations in patient care: so encouraging to see trusts like this blazing a trail on e-prescribing. We know from last week’s landmark study on medication error what a difference this can make to patients: saving lives &amp; averting harm.
Heard today how  @Leic_Hospital is leading the way in improving patient care with some truly groundbreaking work -  particularly encouraging to hear about first ED sepsis team in the NHS and innovative approach to reducing devastating birth injuries
See my discussion on organ donation with @bimbifernando &amp; @DrBruceKeogh earlier today about key issues involved in #organdonation – a taster for the live &amp; fuller discussion on my Facebook page at 1pm on Monday.

Hugely impressive patient safety measures @nhsuhcw – a specialist response team, a focus on learning from deaths and regular patient safety huddles. Thank you for an excellent visit.
Visited @CWPT_NHS yesterday who are blazing a trail in reducing suicides in their care by targeting the most at risk groups and working closely with partners - vital work for delivering the ambition of zero suicides in inpatient mental health services

Agree. Surely we can disagree on Twitter without threatening to kill each other? https://t.co/kUjP1Au5C5
@doctor_oxford @picklepiffle Listen to my remarks on accepting the award when I specifically praised the contribution of remarkable clinicians...but the truth is without the tenaciousness of patient campaigners giving us Francis/Kirkup/Southern Health little would have changed
All our patient safety progress is down to tenacious campaigners who have lost loved ones &amp; turned personal tragedy into a mission to save others:  @JamesTitcombe  @DebHazeldine @curetheNHS @sams_monkey @amotherwithout @MartinBromiley to name a few... https://t.co/SwzRoI8olE
Medication errors blight every health system in the world, causing huge suffering for patients. Join @CMO_England &amp; I on Mon at 1.15pm for a Facebook Live discussion about our ground-breaking research &amp; how we can tackle this issue. Submit questions here: https://t.co/C1TzRWiDNL

Most hospitals have falls prevention programmes but few have taken it as far as @LandDHospital where dementia patients get special care under the Baywatch scheme, as nurse Yvonne Weldon told me https://t.co/3RKIEReEHH
Stillbirth rates have plummeted @GEHNHSnews since increased maternity safety focus. Head of Midwifery Alison Talbot told me how they did it. https://t.co/SdTpVTCtkx
Huge improvement journey @MKHospital from worst A&amp;E in 2014 to ‘Good’ CQC rating - and staff determined to go even further. Thanks for a great session on patient safety. https://t.co/f5OqcvdQQe
At @LandDhospital not only did they achieve 98% A&amp;E patients seen in 4 hours in January but also 58% drop in falls w/ harm &amp; 46% drop in cardiac arrests - shows brilliant performance despite extraordinary pressure.

Passionate discussion at @bedfordhospital about #bawagarba case. Reflective learning VITAL for patient safety and must not be compromised.
Thank you @NGHnhstrust for your time today and for your fantastic efforts over winter - v much enjoyed your ‘Winter Heroes’ campaign https://t.co/3Bap0WxRdG
Patient feedback boosts staff morale and drives improvement - interesting use of iWantGreatCare app @iwgc at @nhftnhs to collect real time feedback, both good and bad, and act immediately where they need to.
No patient should have to leave hospital with added illness - v impressed by focus on hygiene + safety @KettGeneral which cut hospital acquired infections by 70% in past 9 years
Nothing more devastating than losing a baby - @GEHNHSnews undertook major drive to improve maternity safety &amp; reduce stillbirth rates from 0.46% to 0.12% - remarkable results and an example to the rest of the NHS.
#Antibioticresistance like climate change: slow-burn but potentially disastrous  consequences if we do nothing. New study shows we’re approaching tipping point. UK with @CMO_England has led the charge so far but time for other countries to play their part https://t.co/Mibndcln5Q

Is this the same man who has overseen £1.6 bn more being spent on mental health services than 3 yrs ago including £575m more last year? https://t.co/m7NZwWp6xY
Clearly lessons need to be learned by regulators. But there was a time when MPs defended their local health providers irrespective of what patients said - that has now changed and @rosie4westlancs will rightly be an inspiration for many going forward https://t.co/doNDt4Fw8t
I know very concerning. Am meeting Jason Russell, head of roads for Surrey County Council, on Friday to discuss https://t.co/X7BQmahN25
This piece is nonsense. I have a purpose and in 5 yrs it has never changed: to transform patient safety. But in a large brief that doesn't mean u don't also focus on other key areas e.g mental health, cancer, soc care, workforce, tech (&amp; like all health secs performance &amp; money) https://t.co/B0UMhZ3i9A
Listen to @martinbromiley who has done more than anyone I know to help the NHS develop a positive learning culture talk about how we need to get better at supporting staff 3/3 https://t.co/Dnfn5zd4w1
The #bawagarba case will be seen as another watershed moment, &amp; the review I’ve announced today will seek to learn deep lessons on how we respond to similar situations in the future. https://t.co/65MiQ5RaaV 2/3
Five years ago today, the Government responded to the scandal of mid-Staffs, &amp; while much has changed, the case for strong, open, supportive learning cultures has never been more urgent. 1/3
I may disagree with claims made on that march but not ONE of them wants to live in a system where 28m people have no cover. NHS may have challenges but I’m proud to be from the country that invented universal coverage - where all get care no matter the size of their bank balance https://t.co/YJsKBAHsw7
Staff @EHSTNHS asked me telling Qs on CPD and financial pressures yesterday. When I took office I made increasing the clinical workforce a priority: we now have more than 43,000 drs, nurses and other clinicians, but the truth is we still need more
Honest and frank questions from staff @withoutstigma yesterday. We know it’s tough on the front line but your ‘good’ rating from @carequalitycomm shows you’re delivering some of the best care in the face of demand
Some cold, unvarnished facts from @thekingsfund that should dispel any myths about NHS privatisation: “There is little evidence of a significant increase in spending on private providers or widespread privatisation of NHS services.” https://t.co/GKGSZrs4mg

Few have thought harder than @matthewsyed about how to reduce harm in safety-critical industries like healthcare &amp; aviation. A must read on #BawaGarba:  https://t.co/lfwH81UWLI
Reflective practice is at the heart of improving patient safety so it is vital doctors, nurses &amp; midwives are supported to be open and transparent about things that may have gone wrong - see my talk to staff at @kingscollegenhs last October #BawaGarba https://t.co/s2kFugQIvy
.@PCollinsTimes is right that some crucial NHS reforms are going on that reduce demand for hospital services by improving and integrating out of hospital care. Whilst there is a big debate about funding there is wider consensus than I can ever remember about structures https://t.co/FitWZvDqXk

Just been privileged to listen to incredible powerful and moving speech in the Lords by Tessa Jowell on the need to speed up clinical trials process for brain cancer patients. She is of course right and we look carefully at her sensible suggestions.
Wouldn’t be appropriate for me as Govt Minister to criticise a court ruling, but deeply concerned about possibly unintended implications here for learning &amp; reflective practice in e-journals. Am also totally perplexed that GMC acted as they did: patient safety must be  paramount https://t.co/zFTFfe5al8
Congratulations @WestSuffolkNHS on a well-deserved outstanding rating – proof that smaller hospitals can deliver some of the very best care in the country - in the face of huge demands on services. Massive congrats to @stevedunnCEO and all who work at the Trust https://t.co/SoueWmkWaY
@YoungMindsCEO @YoungMindsUK Sarah, many thanks for your inspirational leadership of @youngmindsuk which has helped to put the issue of children’s mental health at the heart of political debate. As you say, there is much more to do but you should be v proud of your achievements.
Important review announced today by @brineminister – addiction to prescription drugs rarely gets attention it deserves, but can be every bit as devastating as ‘hard’ drug addiction if unchecked. Experts will help us understand how to avoid devastating impact seen elsewhere. https://t.co/m2fsCZNjFE

Thanks to staff @teamQEH and @NSFTtweets for really interesting patient safety visits. One trust already out of special measures and one still in - but both making good progress.
.@NNUH: Is this the next big innovation from A&amp;E? An A&amp;E just for older people that has massively increased turnaround times by giving faster access to specialists.
Really clever use of technology at @IpswichHosp to ensure safe staffing levels are maintained throughout the day. Thanks to staff who came for a constructive discussion on safety. https://t.co/MWNRYYj69n
Powerful statement of intent from Helen Vernon – any process of litigation after a clinical error should support efforts to learn lessons for future, &amp; so right that @NHSResolution’s  insights should become an integral part of safety improvement process. https://t.co/4WPv8zwnOy
5 million people say television is their main or only form of company, something that should shame us all - so very much welcome appointment of the brilliant and energetic @tracey_crouch as minister for loneliness
BBC right to acknowledge huge pressures nurses are under, but underplaying the fact we recently announced BIGGEST nurse training place increase in NHS history- an extra 5000. It IS a challenging environment, but nursing still one of the most fulfilling&amp; important roles in society
David’s integrity and leadership were pivotal in our response to Mid-Staffs – and his legacy is more transparency on standards of care than anywhere in the world. The Government, the NHS and patients are hugely in his debt. https://t.co/UHN4PN78rp
The efforts of all staff @WestHertsNHS paying off today as they exit special measures - great start to the New Year https://t.co/OyDlneqJ50
How we treat the elderly is the litmus test of a civilised society. The health &amp; social care systems are umbilically linked, so putting leadership in one govt department makes sense as a first step ahead of a vital green paper.

Tony Blair's memory is as selective in office as out of office: does he not remember his own regular NHS winter crises? Perhaps he was too focused on joining the euro to give his full attention to the NHS...
Starting with tonight, we are moving into what is always the most challenging and stressful week of the year for the NHS. Frontline staff could NOT be working harder to keep patients safe - thank you from the whole country

.@bwc_nhs uses staff engagement to promote patient safety and as the only outstanding rated trust in Birmingham are worth listening to. Thank you to @bwchboss and staff for making me welcome
Staff @bsmhft today rightly told me that in mental health trusts patient safety and staff safety are two sides of the same coin. Thanks for a great visit #mentalhealth #nhs
IMF wrong to put NHS privatisation on the table. It was founded on the back of a White Paper by a Conservative Health Minister in 1944, makes us proud to be British &amp; will remain a National Health Service under this or any Government. https://t.co/TOQ61nmFTv
.@jeremycorbyn you claimed incorrectly that mental health spending has been cut. In fact, it’s gone up both in real terms &amp; as a proportion of NHS spending. #PMQs https://t.co/CHBAroBD17
I agree there are parts of country &amp; individual surgeries that a) are really struggling with recruitment issues b) have not implemented the named GP policy as we hoped.But the suggestion was we are trying to undermine continuity of care when the opposite is the case - it is vital https://t.co/VPQNAKzk3F
Er was that the same @Jeremy_Hunt who brought back named GPs for every patient - something that was removed 10 years earlier in the 2004 GP contract changes? https://t.co/mlm38zubXJ
About to do my first Facebook live session: all are welcome, trolls and fans alike.
Brave but important step for #NHS – we are first organisation in the world to publish estimates of how many patients died because of problems in care. Will embed a learning culture, better protecting patients in the future, and give bereaved families the answers they deserve. https://t.co/IzQPd3TFCZ
Thinking of @amotherwithout today - three years since William died. No-one should have to live through the agony of losing a child. Thanks to his parents' tenacious campaigning he has an amazing legacy: a step-change in sepsis awareness which will save many other lives.
Who's doing the spinning Rachel? Yesterday's draft workforce strategy said there are 40,000 more clinicians in the NHS since 2012. I know we need more but surely even the most hardened opponents of govt must accept that is progress https://t.co/gYufIniA12
On this I totally agree with you Ben. If a trust reports higher avoidable deaths next year rather than this, it may actually be getting safer not less safe because of an improved reporting culture supporting staff to speak out https://t.co/xH0UUASubj
@Unity_portal I am afraid many others would say the same. That is precisely the culture we are trying to change...
Of course safe staffing levels vital for patient safety but it is not always/only about staffing which is why proper learning from ev death critical. On staffing new draft workforce strategy published yesterday - to summarise 40k more clinicians since 2012 but many more needed... https://t.co/35nIoGPEE5
I’ve talked about negative effects of social media recently but here’s one of the positives – clever and simple patient safety ideas like this can spread around the world in hours. Great to see NHS adopting it too #theatrecapchallenge #hellomynameis https://t.co/Mp6rnKOWxX

Not sure this is the right direction at all. Facebook told me they would come back with ideas to PREVENT underage use of their product, but instead they are actively targeting younger children. Stay away from my kids please Facebook and act responsibly! https://t.co/XrwfSHsUMj
@lucianaberger 7/ So given this is a much bigger expansion of mental health provision for young people than ever promised or funded by Labour, please save your mock anger and get behind a plan that will make a massive difference to your constituents and mine!
@lucianaberger 6/ You asked why introduce this in a staged way:because expanding capacity on this scale means training many extra people (thousands more in fact by the end of the Parliament) on top of the 21,000 extra posts we’re already creating for the mental health expansion already underway
@lucianaberger 5) You mentioned a waiting time target for talking therapies, but failed to say this had already been promised by the govt &amp; has now been introduced (latest figures show 88.5% being seen within 6 weeks)
@lucianaberger 4/ Your manifesto did NOT promise a four week waiting time standard for CAMHS so that the children in most urgent need of help are seen within 4 weeks not six months as at present which we now want to roll out
@lucianaberger 3/ Nor did you mention setting up an entirely NEW school support service for children with mild to moderate mental health conditions, meaning for the first time problems will be picked up earlier with the cooperation and help of the teachers who know them best.
@lucianaberger 2/ In fairness your manifesto did talk about training teachers in mental health, but not about a trained senior mental health lead in every single secondary school that brings specialist expertise into schools in a structured way for the first time
@lucianaberger 1/ I respect your campaigning on mental health but before you try to rubbish the new plans on children's mental health let's remind ourselves what they include (most of which were NOT in Labour's manifesto)
…but we’re still not as good as other countries in Western Europe so to deliver our cancer plan I’m today announcing plans to train 300 more endoscopists &amp; 200 more radiographers under our first ever Cancer Workforce Plan https://t.co/4FnAQ0PvOM #BritainAgainstCancer
We are hitting cancer where it hurts: 7,000 people alive today who wouldn’t be if mortality rates had remained at 2010 levels...#BritainAgainstCancer https://t.co/S9LPi1NVUC

New partnership between NHS &amp; schools needed to support young people's mental health more effectively – so £300m push to expand provision in schools in our green paper. #Youngmentalhealth

Ian Dalton will be a worthy successor to the brilliant Jim Mackey as @NHSImprovement CEO - calm, steady, committed &amp; someone who knows about the challenges of running an NHS trust first hand.
...and I look forward to the constructive negotiations continuing, towards a deal which works for our valued NHS staff and our NHS employers.
My comments perhaps accidentally misinterpreted in HSJ interview: I did NOT say junior docs contract was template for Agenda for Change negotiations but DID specify anti-social hours payments would continue. These are different sets of negotiations and should not be conflated.
@LauraPidcockMP As long as I’m Health Secretary NHS care will be taxpayer funded &amp; free at point of use for all - totally irresponsible to make patients fear otherwise without a shred of evidence. See my response to @thatginamiller
@LauraPidcockMP I know like me you care about the NHS so please don’t scare and mislead vulnerable patients in this way. STPs have NOTHING to do an American-style funding system - they are about making care more joined up for patients which is why the NHS &amp; many on the left strongly support them
@thatginamiller 2/2 The STPs are not my plan, they are the NHS responding to its own plan developed by Simon Stevens. But I am backing and funding them because they integrate care (and some say dismantle the single market which you might approve of!)
@thatginamiller 1/2 With respect, this is nonsense. The NHS is one of the best things about our country, and has more docs, nurses and funding than ever (including an extra £2.8 bn in budget) - hardly evidence of 'Americanisation'
Major step forward for maternity safety today in our new #saferbirths strategy – looking into coroners’ powers, supporting local champions and asking new NHS investigator to review c. 1,000 injuries and deaths a year. https://t.co/JTWbLikD2r

Agree with staff @SomParNHS who I met this morning - patient safety and staff safety are two halves of the same coin. Great initiatives at the trust to manage violence and aggression towards staff with less patient restraint.
@MusgrovePark commitment to maternity safety has cut still births by a third in just 18 months. Today I went there to hear about this outstanding work - well done everyone.

26) .... I hope you understand that in the rough and tumble of Twitter sometimes we have to put the record straight! I therefore apologise for this interminably long thread and promise this will be my final tweet on the issue.
25) Frankly anyone who has got this far in the thread deserves a medal for endurance and resilience not least because I am nothing like as witty as @ralflittle...
24) So let’s do a deal: you provide me with evidence that I was – as you claim – deliberately seeking to mislead the public about mental health in my Marr interview &amp; I will happily meet you, factcheckers and all
23) There may be a European country with bigger expansion plans but I have yet to find it. I am sure I don’t get everything right but on the basis of the evidence no reasonable person could describe the claim as “knowingly lying’
22) More on this here https://t.co/HVvQ4b1Wi2
21) Perhaps you can see from the facts above why both I and the NHS England Chief Exec DO believe this is the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe… https://t.co/HVOnkgYWZi
20) Now let’s remind ourselves of your claim, that when I said this was the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe I ‘knowingly lied’. Here’s the tweet: https://t.co/ux490G9eBI
19) But there is still MUCH more to do. In fact we are only two years in to a five year plan that will see us treating a million more people by 2020/21 compared to when we started. Here’s the plan https://t.co/jgEpslR9AS
18) We have also seen significant improvements in crisis care including the roll-out of liaison psychiatry to over 90% of A&amp;Es, of which half are 24/7. This may have contributed to a 6% fall in suicide rates https://t.co/V9WtshFEjR
17) The New York Times praised the expansion of talking therapies as “the world’s most ambitious effort to treat depression, anxiety and other common mental illnesses” https://t.co/U3ppmgFBRX
16) This has delivered some notable improvements in mental health in the last 7 years including the introduction of waiting times standards for psychosis and talking therapies for the first time anywhere in the world (with standards for eating disorders to follow)
15)...with CCGs increasing spend by 6.3% vs an overall increase of 3.7% in their funding - in other words spending up both in absolute terms and as a proportion of NHS spend https://t.co/jDMRXEM4tC
14) What about the dosh? Extra staff cost money so this is what the data shows last year alone spending on mental health went up by £575m https://t.co/oEzilsOTKQ
13) My biggest area of concern is actually children and young people, because half of all conditions become established before the age of 14. So we will shortly be publishing a green paper on children and young people’s mental health to address this https://t.co/EP8j5Fpw2n
12) But ‘more’ mental health staff does NOT mean ‘enough’ staff and still too many patients wait too long. That’s why we published plans in July for an additional 21,000 posts https://t.co/KmF2WPPSwm
11)....so I have corrected the record. But 12,700 more doctors and 10,600 more nurses on our wards since 2010, including 4,300 more MH staff since 2013 isn’t a bad thing surely? https://t.co/K3QvmQnS02
10) You are correct that I did misread a briefing and tell the House of Commons that there was a 30,000 increase in mental health staff when I should have said a 30,000 increase in NHS clinical staff including in mental health…
9) So to fill the gap we now have 8,000 MH nurses in training and have this Sept announced an increase in nurse training places overall by 25% https://t.co/6FZIAW0Rw8
8) ...there were too many hospital wards with dangerously low staffing so in the last five years have increased hospital nursing staff by almost 13,000. Whilst this has been good for hosps, it has been challenging for MH
7) @ralflittle you pointed out that mental health nurses have gone down. This is correct, even though overall numbers working in mental health have gone up. Why? Because post Mid Staffs we realised…
6) ...The data we have takes us from 2012 https://t.co/CKlDfaCcPv to 2015 https://t.co/zrmEERtaAs
5) And here’s how we get the increase in talking therapies staff of over 2000, some of which will overlap with the trust figure because some IAPT services are provided by trusts (although many aren’t)…
4) ....more than 2,000 of which are fully qualified (e.g. not the reduction of 167 in the fullfact piece you linked). https://t.co/pS5O3j8Qq1
3) Parity of esteem for mental health became law in 2012, so here are the tables that show the 4,300 increase in staff at mental health trusts since 2013…
@RalfLittle 2) Now I know you are a funny bloke and in politics a lot of insults are traded but the question is can you back up what is a very strong claim?
(1) Let’s get to the bottom of this issue shall we @RalfLittle? I talked about the biggest expansion of mental health provision in Europe which you described as ‘knowingly lying’

Corbyn 'I have not supported any of those organisations' - just stood on a platform with them and called them 'friends'
Corbyn won't commit to EVER using nuclear weapons. That means deterrent is dead if he becomes PM
Corbyn avoiding question to what he would do if under threat of nuclear attack. Because he doesn't know
Lab manifesto 'serious and realistic'? Surely not with £30 bn black hole according to IFS
Rising corp tax will cripple small businesses - the way to fund the NHS is to help businesses like this gentleman's expand not hobble them
'No deal better than a bad deal' - the biggest Brexit dividing line. Has Jeremy Corbyn ever negotiated anything?
In education and health it isn't just how much money surely it's about spending it better = a fair funding formula only this PM willing 2 do
Surely Theresa May gets to heart of issue on mental health when she says it is all about early intervention
Who is the PM who has done more 4 mental health than any other? Theresa May. £1.4 bn more this yr vs 3 years ago, 120,000 more treated ev yr
11,000 more docs and 12,000 more nurses compared to 2010 - not possible without public sector pay restraint
£3.9 bn more on NHS and social care being spent this year than Lab promised in 2015
45,000 had to sell their houses to pay for care under Labour - only this PM willing to tackle this unfairness
We do NOT have cap now - Dilnot proposals would have meant funding it through taxation on younger people so we will have fairer solution
Who else has been honest abt problems in social care and come up with a solution? W.s have been easy 2 duck but Theresa May tackling head on
The kind of weak Jeremy Corbyn performance tonight that he would show when negotiating on Brexit and managing coalition of chaos #BBCDebate
A coalition of chaos with each boasting about putting up people's taxes and undermining people's decision on Brexit. #BBCdebate
He talks about leadership taking advice but Jeremy Corbyn ignores the 172 of his own MPs who begged him to resign #BBCdebate
Amber Rudd a class apart. Only one with serious substantial answers. We can't leave Brexit in hands of others in this shambles #BBCDebate
Jeremy Corbyn has opposed every piece of anti-terrorism legislation for a generation. He cannot hide from this shameful record. #BBCDebate
The coalition of chaos congratulating each other for sharing regressive and uncosted policies #BBCdebate
Critical pt from Amber. We r spending half a trillion ££ on the NHS over 5 years but all at risk from Labour's fantasy economics #BBCDebate
A vote for anyone but Theresa May puts Corbyn in power, propped up by the chaotic squabbling of Nicola Sturgeon and Tim Farron.#BBCDebate
Corbyn muddling the debt and deficit again. The kind of forgetfulness and fantasy economics that destroys jobs and incomes. #BBCdebate
Cutting taxes on business helped create 2.9 million jobs, and has increased tax receipts. That's how to fund our public services #BBCdebate
Choices even clearer - tax rises from the SNP, Lib Dems and Labour, whom the IFS are clear would need to hit ordinary families #BBCDebate
A successful Brexit and a strong economy, or a coalition of chaos from the rest. A clear choice set out by Amber Rudd.  #BBCDebate
TM v clear why we cannot continue to duck long term challenge of social care funding, and how our proprosals are fairer #BattleForNumber10
Theresa May very clear how she will face up to huge challenges and choices we face, including on health and social care #BattleForNumber10
The PM clear on how we are providing record funding to our NHS. Only Labour can explain why they cut NHS budget in Wales #BattleForNumber10
Record education funding enabled by a strong economy, can only be protected if we back Theresa May to see Brexit through #BattleForNumber10
Reassuring, clear response from PM on why we have to ensure a sustainable social care system, confronting the challenge #BattleForNumber10
Again Corbyn attempting to distance himself from his own publicly stated views, now saying his own manifesto isn't really his #battleforNo10
Corbyn says he wants a deal with EU at any cost, but the price would be paid by families and business across our country #BattleForNumber10
Destroying businesses, jobs and incomes with higher taxes does nothing to help funding for vital services like our NHS #BattleForNumber10
Having refused seven times to say he would definitely leave the EU, Corbyn is unfit to negotiate a good deal for Britain #BattleForNumber10
Corbyn's weak responses on leadership Qs show just why three-quarters of his own MPs don’t support him #BattleForNumber10

Looking forward to this evening’s EU Referendum Hustings in Haslemere and Farnham #Remain
#bbcqt audience member spot on to say we must think of effect on younger people of a vote to leave
#bbcqt PM says Churchill didn't desert Europe &amp; nor should we - passion carried an audience that was sceptical earlier
#bbcqt those cynical abt politician promises on EU shld remember PM won't fight another gen election- he is doing this from 100% conviction
#bbcqt 'total control' does not automatically mean lower migration: Non-EU Australia has twice as much migration per head as us
#bbcqt people who work in NHS don't want us to leave EU - because pressure comes largely from ageing population, not young EU migrants
#bbcqt PM clear: leaving single market wrong way to control immigration
Around #confed2016 I also met staff at the Salford Together vanguard - showing how integration improves care quality. Thanks for your time!
Great to meet staff at Royal Lancaster and see how a learning culture is helping to transform their quality of care https://t.co/bLn7TAEUVE

Responsible Prime Ministers have a duty to remind ppl of risks: decision on 23 June must be hard-headed and pragmatic if we r 2 protect NHS
More nonsense from Farage on NHS this morning: most European migrants are young &amp;non-heavy NHS users - and we recharge their home countries
Brave decision by @sarahwollaston shows her commitment to NHS and concerns about impact of Brexit recession on public services
PM nailed it tonight, confident and commanding. Farage looked uncomfortable #ITVEUREF
There was no plan from Nigel Farage for our future or for our economy, meaning big risks 4 NHS #ITVEUREF
Fact of having EU referendum best example of sovereignty, PM says. Sovereignty is control of your destiny not Brexit impotence #ITVEURef
We have the right to reclaim costs from EU citizens who use the NHS #ITVEURef
Net EU contributions could only run NHS for 19 days but for the other 346 days NHS needs a strong economy not a Brexit recession#ITVEURef
PM taking critics head on over renegotiation, expert predictions on economy #ITVEUREF
Farage just skewered by member of audience calling out UKIP dogwhistle politics
1 in 10 UK jobs are linked to our trade with the EU, many in pharmaceuticals Nigel #ITVEUREF
Gove is wrong on NHS: we have the right to recharge other EU countries when their nationals use the NHS
Michael is a great debater - but leaving EU is not 'taking back control' it is surrendering control to a huge block on our doorstep

Chancellor confirmed today we are giving NHS an extra £3.8bn next yr &amp; £10bn over the Parliament to fund its plan for the future.
Our focus now is protecting patients on strike days; NHS med director Bruce Keogh has written to BMA seeking urgent assurances on safety.
Disappointing news re strike ballot. Still time to avert action that harms patients; I invite BMA again to come &amp; talk about any concerns.
I’ve written to French Health Minister to offer our support &amp; solidarity in the wake of the Paris atrocities. Vive La France.
Read my letter to BMA confirming there aren’t &amp; never have been preconditions to #juniorcontract negotiations: https://t.co/XDNwK23BRQ
.@duncanbew @Dannythefink @drhjefferson no preconditions, but have to reserve right to deliver manifesto's 7 day reforms if no progress made
Absolutely @MartinBromiley - I think IPSIS will be game-changer in helping bring down stillbirth/newborn death rate. Thanks 4 all your work.
.@Dannythefink @drhjefferson @Maccatune 22 pre-conditions claim is total myth. We just need to deal with weekend effect within pay envelope.
.@JamesTitcombe thanks for your tireless campaigning. Want to make sure no other family has to go through pain &amp; heartache you&amp;Hoa suffered.
Commitment to create a truly 7 day NHS if progress isn't made 2/2.
BMA's strike threat appalling and damaging for patients. We will still negotiate about anything - but must proceed with our manifesto 1/2
Today we launch drive to halve stillbirths&amp;newborn deaths.UK has lagged other countries on these rates for too long: https://t.co/HeHuxlQRIc

Thanks to @TheKingsFund &amp; @healthfdn for work on measuring quality across local areas. Smart data is key to making NHS the best in the world
Thoughts with Pauline Cafferkey today as she battles Ebola for the second time. In best poss place under care of Dr Mike Jacobs at RoyalFree

@George_Osborne confirmed today that this Gvt’s priority is the NHS – which will get £10 billion more in real terms by 2020 #summerbudget
With new culture focused on compassion &amp; safety we can draw a line under the horrors of Mid Staffs.
In health Q.s I set out progress in 21 hospitals in special measures: 458 more Drs &amp; 1012 more nurses hired.
Dementia care remains a top priority: we're rolling out named GPs, dementia advisors &amp; training NHS staff 2 offer support. More still to do
Britain can be best country in the world to grow old in, but that means all of us stepping up to look out for older relatives &amp; neighbours.
Spoke to #LGAConf15 about facing up to uncomfortable truths on the lonely elderly in our midst. 8 lonely funerals a day is a national shame.
A face-to-face apology for mistakes can make a big difference to patients: http://t.co/UyuKcOy2J2

We'll support GPs too with workforce changes - 1,000 more Physician Associates and £7.5m new funding to help and expand community pharmacy.
We want 5,000 more GPs by 2020 - the biggest chance for more investment in a generation, which will help deliver 7 day services #GPnewdeal
Setting out first steps in a new deal for GPs today - general practice will be single biggest area of change in the NHS over next 5 years.
Congratulations @sarahwollaston on your re-election as chair of the Health Committee - expert and insightful leadership for 5 more years!
Just watched a human heart start beating again after surgery at Papworth. Incredibly proud of world-beating innovation &amp; great care in NHS

Shocking that 1300 babies killed or harmed during childbirth last year: we must go further&amp;faster to make the NHS the safest system globally
Full fact says @andyburnhammp's 'misleading' on nurse numbers. We called time on the scandal of short-staffed wards: https://t.co/gT160sHCIO

Looking forward to speaking to @TheKingsFund leadership summit later. Strong &amp; inspirational leadership has never been more vital for NHS.
Heartbreaking cases of poor end of life care in today's Ombudsman report. This is why our tough new CQC inspections are so important.
Dementia remains one of my big priorities as Health Secretary. Still determined to lead global quest for cure or treatment by 2020.#DAW2015
It's dementia awareness week. Shocking @alzheimerssoc stat that 7000 people have received a dementia diagnosis since polling day. #DAW2015
Too many die avoidably due to lack of 24/7 NHS: this Gov will tackle that. NHS founding principle is good healthcare whenever you need it.
My mission this Parliament is to transform GP services, especially 4 older ppl. Aiming for 50% of med school grads to choose GP in future.
Finally, thanks to my fav Lib Dem @normanlamb. A gentleman &amp;real pleasure to work with. Determined to build on his legacy on mental health.
Thanks also 2 @drdanpoulter for his hard work &amp; talent as a Minister: we really benefitted from his clinical expertise &amp;frontline experience
Sad to say bye to Earl Howe but wish him all the best @ MoD: perhaps the nicest man in politics as well as a brilliant&amp;hard-working Minister
Fantastic team completed by David Prior in the Lords - a real patients' champion who has led transformation of healthcare inspection regime
Delighted to welcome @AlistairBurtMP and @ben4ipswich to the DH, and so pleased to have @janeellisonmp and @Freeman_George back.
.@PaulGoodmanCH thanks. Lab rhetoric didn't fit with most voters' experience of quick, good care from staff doing amazing job under pressure
Our nursing staff are the envy of the world - read stories from the frontline through #MyNursingDay #IND2015
Today is International Nurses Day - proud to celebrate the hard work of all who are crucial to delivering safe compassionate care #IND2015
NHS was on ballot paper &amp; top issue 4 voters. Pleased they placed trust in Conservatives to steward our most treasured national institution.
Delighted to be back at health and continuing my mission of making the NHS the safest &amp; most caring system in the world
Brilliant news about @KellyTolhurst who will be a terrific MP for Rochester &amp; Strood. Hooray!
Will really miss Lee Scott, brilliant local MP for Ilford North who spoke to me many times about local NHS issues

2nd election in a row where Lab refusing to give NHS the ££ it needs. Without 8bn we risk going back 2 Mid Staffs style short-staffed wards
Wrong @andyburnhammp. Deficits caused by NHS hiring many more nurses to avoid repeat of Mid Staffs &amp; other hospital tragedies on your watch.
Good evening canvassing with @Rachel44Morris in Farnham - Rachel will be a brilliant Waverley councillor http://t.co/2QYy1jvw2u
Really sorry re what hpnd 2 LibDem Patrick Haveron in SWS. Whatever our political differences he is a decent man.Feels like innocent mistake
#bbcqt is this the first QT where we have had proper voice from people running businesses? Never thought I wld praise BBC for balance but...
#bbcqt Ed Miliband now wants to work with private sector he has been vilifying for 4 years
#bbcqt feels like country has looked at Ed M carefully over last three weeks and decided it wants to look into the abyss no longer
Exactly...when you need to vote more money to renew Trident https://t.co/ghVsFmHah8
#bbcqt Mili: no coalition with SNP, no confidence and supply does not rule out vote by vote support, what is worrying people most right now
#bbcqt not going to do a deal with the SNP is not the same as governing only thanks to their support
#bbcqt Miliband trying to switch from deficit to cuts - young person from audience not buying it
#bbcqt Miliband being murdered by audience member 'you spent spent' looking v uncomfortable
#bbcqt Miliband still refuses to say Labour spent too much -  but 5 mins ago he said he had 'learned lessons' #JustNotUpToIt
#bbcqt Balls should have been fired, Leeds businesswoman tells Miliband. Killer blow
#bbcqt that Leeds businesswomen speaking for entrepreneurs up and down the country
#bbcqt Miliband says he's learnt lesson of financial crisis - but wants to tear up plan that has turned round British economy
#bbcqt no one could say there is no passion or energy in DC campaign after that performance
#bbcqt David Cameron on fire tonight - and managing humour. Saving best till last
#bbcqt PM doesn't want to go into a dark room with Nick Clegg - nor do British people
#bbcqt DC best answer yet on moral value of getting someone a job
Conservatives offer more for NHS for second election in a row https://t.co/44Otj4efv8
@jreedmp so why isn't Labour putting a penny more into it?
#bbcqt A &amp; E performance in England better than Wales (Lab) or Scotland (SNP) or any other country in world that measures it
#bbcqt David Cameron 7 day NHS pledge: better for working people and safer for patients
#bbcqt patient dissatisfaction with NHS lowest ever under DC who reversed Lab plan to cut health budget
#bbcqt cruellest cut of all the cut to pay packets from Labour tax rises
#bbcqt Child poverty DOWN under Cameron: the 'sordid truth' other parties won't acknowledge
#bbcqt lot of passion from Cameron tonight and audience responding
#bbcqt PM: child poverty has fallen under this govt - awkward stat for Lab
#bbcqt PM: big issue is whether we want to continue reforming welfare to make sure work pays big applause
Thx to @MarcusFysh GPs and staff of the Crewkerne practice in Yeovil for a great visit and a very useful discussion! http://t.co/ZPCtO4LzUy
@drmarielouise e.g. exactly what Simon Stevens asked for. Compares to £7 bn real terms increase in NHS budget over 5 yrs of this parliament
@drmarielouise we committed 2 raise annual budget by £10 bn per annum real terms - £2 bn this year and progressively a further £8 bn by 2020
Fascinating visit to new Battersea Power Station development with my brilliant ministerial colleague @JaneEllison http://t.co/uX3qA4vCwE
Good visit to GP surgery in Calverton to discuss more investment in community care with our brilliant @Mark_Spencer http://t.co/UGWrXjYWfK
Growth is crucial to fund NHS as population ages: no doubt Miliband/SNP are committed to NHS but big questions over their ability to fund it
Economy now grown by nearly 10% over last 5 years: this is the track record that means we can commit to £8bn over next 5 years.
Meeting nurses in Skegness with @mattwarman and then onto with Mablethorpe with Vicky Atkins - great new candidates http://t.co/mazmkJN7xf
Very enjoyable hustings in Godalming today - lots of issues covered http://t.co/RBjO6OKe8j
In case anyone tempted by latest Lab NHS scaring: Cons NHS has LOWER % private income, FEWER taking out priv insurance &amp; MORE state funding
Don't believe UKIP will take Thurrock. @JackieDP is a fantastic campaigner and has been a brilliant MP http://t.co/qZZ6NZcoNu
@TomAlexHilton forgot to mention Lab's financial crisis in 2010? Darling budget planned to cut health instead of protecting it as we did
Looking forward to the @agendaitv tonight with @tombradby. Last time reviewed Zero Dark Thirty for them &amp; was fun discussion
Good meeting with Alz Soc volunteers in Chippenham wth @michelledonelan discussing best way to improve post diag care http://t.co/8WoOKvQk2s
Labour line u can avoid 8bn gap by changing EU competition rules not credible. W'out 8bn NHS could go back 2 Mid Staffs-like staff shortages
.@andyburnhammp happy 2 compare records: u left M.Staffs &amp; 22 failing hospitals,I'm building NHS patients say's never been safer/more caring

Fantastic afternoon campaigning with @JackieDP in Thurrock, been a fantastic MP for last 5 years http://t.co/INjew3mAEv
Enjoyed the #healthdebate. All parties are committed to the NHS; the question is who has the economic credibility to fund it properly?
Great visit to Colchester Hospital's maternity unit with @willquince - a great local candidate http://t.co/ikCSD59Zts
Sturgeon sets out in clear terms how she would build alliances with Labour MPs to increase spending, taxes &amp; borrowing. #SNPManifesto
Ipswich A &amp; E rated outstanding &amp; I can see why. Congrats 2 commuted staff &amp; @ben4ipswich 4 campaign for heart unit http://t.co/ZiiPSwR6UD
Sturgeon should heed Greece, Portugal &amp; Italy if she wants to increase NHS spending: they cut health spend because they crashed the economy
Sturgeon's shopping list grows ever larger: just like our national debt would under a Miliband-SNP alliance. #snpmanifesto
Terrifying to hear SNP fantasy economics that would be unleashed on UK under a Miliband gov: how can increasing the deficit bring down debt?
Sturgeon's 'promise' to ppl in Eng, Wales &amp; NI: more spending, more taxes, more borrowing for you &amp; your family. Scary stuff. #snpmanifesto
I warned NHS not to repeat BBC mistakes on high pay, &amp; tackled worst abuses of Lab's system. Clearly more to do: http://t.co/9VgosK4J8Y
Concerned by Mail pay story: running a hospital is a tough job, but high salaries only justifiable where results 4 patients are exceptional
Bizarre Labour campaign today: they claim NHS is on life support yet still the only party to refuse to fund the £8bn NHS says it needs.
Finally on this: who upped hospital nurses by 8000?Conservatives. Who left hospitals wth short-staffed wards/Mid Staffs? Lab. No lessons pls
HEE report Lab 'quotes': 13,048 more nurses supplied by 2019, &amp; that's b4 extra £8 bn promised by future Cons govt
Labour's source for today's unravelling nursing announcement:a Health Education England report that actually says nursing numbers will go up

Fire in the PM's belly today: passion and conviction as he asks for 5 more years to finish the job. #VoteConservative
Fantastic childcare pledge: as dad of three under five I know what a game-changer this will be for many families. #VoteConservative
PM promises £8bn more for the NHS so it's there for your family 7 days a week. Proud to be the party who will back &amp; fund the NHS 5 yr plan.
'We'll be back in the black, but only if the Conservatives are back in Government: a brighter, more secure future for you and your family.'

.@andyburnhammp then why did this Govt find £2bn for NHS frontline NEXT YEAR in Autumn Statement that Lab neither planned or budgeted for?
.@andyburnhammp NHS needs a Gov to back &amp; fund their own 5 year plan. Sadly they can't rely on Labour for either: http://t.co/RyfkPr62bZ
Astonishing that @andyburnhammp not backing NHS 5 year plan: does he really think he knows better than all the national NHS bodies combined?
Visiting @MulberryCentre with @MaryMacleod2015 seeing inspirational work for cancer sufferers http://t.co/zcPE7m6xL0
Lab manifesto:'everyone must learn lessons' when things like Mid Staffs go wrong. Incl ministers resp 4 Lab's targets culture? Same old Lab
Confirmed: Lab will abandon the NHS plan &amp;won't give it the funding it needs. That's what happens when you have no plan for a strong economy
Astonishing Labour health manifesto doesn’t mention NHS’ 5 yr plan; not just refusing to fund it but ripping it up too.
Ed Balls confirmed on #r4today he won’t fund NHS plan. Will be worrying for NHS leaders relying on Gov to do their bit to secure NHS’ future
Here's a reminder of the difference that a strong economy makes to the NHS: http://t.co/azHMAD2u2e
Here's what Miliband forgot to mention  on NHS 'privatisation': http://t.co/CBe6hMtkJ8
Miliband calls his £2.5bn pledge 'a fully funded plan'.  Think you'll find the NHS disagrees Ed.  They say they need £8bn.
Labour still don't get it: no point talking about strong public services if you can't create the jobs that pay the taxes to fund them.
With @cmackinlay campaigning in South Thanet. Good visit to local GP and Age Concern. Warm &amp; engaging candidate! http://t.co/IPAx5cbUZj
Labour promised 'no more borrowing' in their 1997 manifesto...that pledge ended with largest deficit in peacetime history. #SameOldLabour
Miliband says Britain succeeds 'when hospitals aren't cut back to the bone.'  Agreed.  So where's the £8bn pledge for the NHS' 5 year plan?
Ed Miliband confirms they won't pay for NHS plan: simple truth is they can't grow the economy so they can't fund the NHS. #LabourManifesto
Great weekend canvassing in North Farnham, tremendous enthusiasm amongst my local team http://t.co/b094EkoL5R
@andyburnhammp no correct parallel with 2010 is that once again Lab planning to go into election spending less on NHS than Conservatives
Sad that Labour has dumped the NHS's own plan for reform, the 5 Year Forward View. Labour won't fund it and no mention in their manifesto.
Labour talk big but invest less on the NHS: http://t.co/IErO5tE1fq
Big moment for the NHS today as we commit £8bn for their plan.  An economy creating 1000 jobs a day can fund great public services.

Excellent visit to MK Uni hospital with @MarkLancasterMK and Iain Stewart. Terrific staff commitment to patient care http://t.co/3CBt5VOK8l
Danger of pol football debate is we lose focus on patients, quality &amp;  demographic challenges. @andyburnhammp, we need a better NHS debate.
It’s day 10 of the campaign &amp; already @LabourHealth have put out dodgy GP stats, false privatisation claims &amp; lies on Tory spending plans.
‘Instead of using the NHS as a political football, wouldn’t it be better if Labour started putting patients first?’ http://t.co/YPhsg3kEAb
Great news re brand new A &amp; E for Croydon Uni Hospital thanks to superb campaigning by @BackBarwell &amp; @chrisphilp4mp http://t.co/11oxql0pLQ
@jappleby123 DH finance will confirm those figures John
A&amp;E weaponising is wearing thin.Scotland, NI &amp; Lab-run Wales all WORSE than England; how can Labour justify making A&amp;E a political football?
.@LabourHealth hypocrisy knows no bounds: they call 93.6% A&amp;E performance in Eng a crisis; yet service they run in Wales only manages 83.8%.
A&amp;E facts: in face of unprecedented demand, NHS saw 9/10 patients in less than 4 hrs - best performance in UK and world.
@LabourList Is poster picture of docs &amp; nurses who'd be laid off if Lab ruined economy again? 9k more docs 7k more nurses under coalition
@LabourHealth @jreedmp @andyburnhammp so why did Labour remove it in Wales?
.@andyburnhammp's GP figures incorrect&amp; outdated. Let's have a robust NHS debate, but let's make sure it's based on fact not scaremongering.
Unbelievable Lab hypocrisy on GP access: in Wales they scrapped the 48 hr appointment target they now want for England
. @andyburnhammp @normanlamb in fact, mental health spending up in real terms over the Parliament, and outturn spend up £300m just this year
#leadersdebate well we know two things: only one leader has plan and only one cares about creating more jobs &amp; it's the one running country
#leadersdebate PM makes powerful plea to finish the job: jobs, security and the NHS
#leadersdebate Mili argument on putting working people first = higher taxes and fewer jobs for same working people

#leadersdebate youth unemployment fallen at record rates, that's not just the 'rich' Nigel
#leadersdebate jobs have got to be the most important thing for young people. So stick with a plan that's working...
#leadersdebate so what happened to youth unemployment under Labour Ed?
#leadersdebate best way to help younger people? Make sure NHS there for them when they get older. Needs strong economy not tearing up plan
#leadersdebate Mili: changed your approach to what exactly? No answers to how Lab would control immigration
#leadersdebate PM nails Farage no referendum if UKIP lets in Lab through backdoor
#leadersdebate Mili ducking issue of Lab failures on immigration
#leadersdebate Farage back foot to Lab govt, Mili confirms with huge grin
#leadersdebate only Cam giving plan on immigration

#leadersdebate NHS become best in world under Cameron with public confidence at near record levels http://t.co/bJXTWNDAil
#leadersdebate was that it from Mili on NHS? PM dominated
#leadersdebate 1600 more GPs up 5% under coalition
#leadersdebate Notice no reply from Miliband on Mid Staffs which Lab did nothing to solve for 4 years
#leadersdebate PM direct hit on Mid Staffs, Miliband struggling
#leadersdebate PM mentions improving quality of care post Mid Staffs: Mili literally nothing to say
#leadersdebate Italy, Ireland, Greece, Portugal  cut their health budgets because like Lab they didn't have a plan
#leadersdebate on 'privatisation' scaremongering I agree with Nick
#leadersdebate PM made first mention of dementia affecting 800,000 families in UK
#leadersdebate PM on NHS: we want doctors with stethoscopes not bureaucrats with clipboards
#leadersdebate 10x more people waiting for operation in Wales where NHS run by Lab
#leadersdebate Clegg right on mental health but don't forget PM commitments delivered on dementia
#leadersdebate Miliband seems to totally ignore his own record in Wales where Lab CUT budget
#leadersdebate PM: more docs and nurses than ever under coalition http://t.co/JRF1jqJopz
#leadersdebate NHS became best in world under PM, not how you left it Ed http://t.co/kAJp7xai8V
#leadersdebate NHS in Wales run by Lab: nearly twice as many waiting too long in A &amp; E and for ambulances
#leadersdebate nonsense on NHS 'privatisation' exposed in this graph http://t.co/yvFXKHelmV
#leadersdebate Farage different to UKIP general secretary who said NHS 'biggest waste of money'
#leadersdebate NHS funding up £5 bn per annum in real terms on back of strong economy
#leadersdebate PM swipes them aside with more debt and more taxes charge
#leadersdebate Sturgeon looks like she would be senior partner in SNP Lab deal
#leadersdebate PM killer line: we'll eliminate deficit without reaching into pockets of working people
#leadersdebate Direct hit from PM on Lab running out of money: no wonder Mili hates talking about past
#leadersdebate PM talks of most painful cut if all: Lab cutting take home pay with new taxes
#leadersdebate Clegg in trouble: weren't u DPM for last 5 years?
#LeadersDebate we have more doctors, nurses and midwives than ever without Lab tax rises
#LeadersDebate Mili makes no mention of causes of deficit e.g his policies
#LeadersDebate #LeanneWood austerity only failed in Wales because Lab cut NHS budget
#LeadersDebate PM: we will go on reinvesting in NHS but only if country sticks to plan
#LeadersDebate Mili says NHS going backwards but this table shows under coalition became best in world http://t.co/QmOJqC847s
#LeadersDebate DC makes first mention of new jobs and new money for NHS

UK now 1st country globally 2 offer Men B vaccine for babies. Terrible disease dreaded by parents everywhere; this is a huge step forward.
@curetheNHS Fair pt abt patient satisfaction kept artificially high by ministers in last govt discouraging 'bad news' not tackling poor care
Read about our plans for a truly seven day NHS: http://t.co/Q0uIa8bf4m

Watch @andyburnhammp again on Newsnight to see why Labour's privatisation scaremongering is based on a lie: http://t.co/jHJPwghYTq
Wonder if today's profit ''cap" will  have turned into a "freeze" by tomorrow given Miliband's chaotic track record.
.@Ed_Miliband this is simply a gimmick to scare people about privatisation that isn't happening. Here are the facts: http://t.co/5UE9GqEmKw
Read my latest message to NHS staff - http://t.co/Zu2yIILyJo
The more we saw of Ed M the less he felt like a PM
How does making Britain 'work for working people' square with economic mess Lab left behind?
Feel I saw side to DC much more human than we normally see on TV, think audience interaction worked well
Biggest change re public private NHS provision is govt has taken decision from ministers and given it 2 doctors
Seeing the warmer side to DC we see in cabinet and which never comes over in PMQs
Nice modest finish from DC and overall kept his cool
Serious defence of difficult foreign policy issues - can anyone imagine Miliband doing this?
76% of jobs full time under this govt, 1000 jobs created every single day
DC coming across as sincere and serious in opening few minutes of Paxo interview
New law to protect whistleblowers applying for NHS jobs from discrimination passed today. Speaking up for patients must never be penalised.
As @TheKingsFund point out, more NHS spending in future relies on growing economy. Need to stick to plan that's creating 1000 jobs a day.
.@TheKingsFund find NHS performing well despite big challenges: record numbers of doctors and nurses doing record numbers of operations.
More to do but huge progress on cancer since 2010. NHS diagnosing &amp; treating more ppl than ever before; result is more survivors than ever.

Labour's NHS plans exposed again as cynical attempt to weaponise rather than credible plan to improve patient care: http://t.co/OkUAVxICpJ
.@Independent @LabourHealth  Not true. Extra £1.25bn for child mental health services, &amp; plans for strong economy to underpin a strong NHS.
83.8% of Welsh patients seen in less than 4 hours in A&amp;E v.s 92.8% in England. Another reason weaponising the NHS won't work.

Never again must the power of money or celebrity blind us to clear signals that extremely vulnerable people being abused. #SavileReport
2days report uncovers true scale of Jimmy Savile's crimes in the NHS: these were horrific acts &amp; many vulnerable people were badly let down.
Read my letter to @jreedmp on Labour's breathtaking privatisation hypocrisy: http://t.co/oM26OkCMwG
Labour talk about integration but did nothing in 13 yrs - now this govt is doing it for real, perhaps some grudging support?
5 Yr Forward View suggested evolution of different care models in different regions: Mancs integration is 1st step in this exciting process.
In fact, local doctors now decide whether to tender for big contracts - these rules just mean if they do, they should publicise it.
Last health questions of this Parliament today. Labour alleging fiction that all contracts must be put out to European tender in a year.
Great news that teenage pregnancy rate dropped again this year - now at lowest level since records began
At health Q.s I set out the facts on public view of NHS under this Government. Dissatisfaction at record low: http://t.co/67qaLbKDqc

Still more to do...I want new law to protect whistleblowers applying for NHS jobs from discrimination to be passed this Parliament.
Big culture change on avoidable deaths: from system that denied high mortality to one that acts to saves lives. NHS staff should be proud.
Pleased that Francis has found huge progress since last report. Massive strides taken on NHS safety, compassion&amp;transparency in last 2 yrs.
Shocking egs of whistleblower treatment in Francis. Today we call time on bullying&amp;intimidation - has no place in modern, compassionate NHS.
Big day for NHS tomorrow with Francis whistleblowing report. Much culture change since last report, but more to do: http://t.co/iaETmsJiSs

The graph that explains why weaponising the NHS will never work for Labour: http://t.co/POlUTVGrSk
.@andyburnhammp agency rise due to more nurses on wards. We'll learn from Mid Staffs inquiry you say was a mistake: http://t.co/6ng0oqVU2u
Despite cuts elsewhere,we've protected NHS budget &amp;found extra £2bn 4 next year: only possible by ignoring siren voices &amp;focusing on deficit
PAC right re pressures on NHS budget.Only small increases possible due 2 deficit,but economic turnaround means much bigger increase in 15-16
Congratulations to the staff of @StGeorgesTrust which has just become a Foundation Trust - a fantastic achievement!

Great news that NHS satisfaction's risen significantly; real tribute 2 staff who are working tirelessly for patients: http://t.co/zkrtncTIh8
Labour should focus on improving care for patients in Wales instead of trying to score political points in England.
Today Wales published worst ambulance response times since current records began, only 43% of most urgent calls answered on time...
2/2 Local operational decision in West Mids which had nothing to do with Ministers being cynically exploited by @andyburnhammp for politics.
1/2 Another day another example of Labour trying to weaponise the NHS, this time on major incidents guidance...
But this pay offer gives 1.1m hardworking NHS staff a payrise without costing the taxpayer more money. The lowest paid will get £800 more.
We've consistently said we wouldn't agree to anything that risked jobs and patient safety - and the NHS paybill won't increase next year.
The deal we've put forward on NHS pay is good news for patients, and I welcome the unions calling off strike action.
2/2, the lesson for Ed is put patients before politics &amp; tackle poor care: sadly a lesson Labour didn't learn in M. Staffs or Wales
@Ed_Miliband wants national lessons learned on how George Eliot has gone from special measures to CQC 'good' rating: http://t.co/vLN85qTIjA
@Ed_Miliband, George Eliot great eg of @LabourHealth danger; high death rates ignored under Lab, special measures &amp;turnaround under this Gov
Given Greece had to cut health budget by 14%, biggest threat to NHS is Labour economic policies which fail to control the deficit.
The only way to fund extra investment in the NHS is through a strong economy, which @UKLabour have yet to show they can deliver.
I called elderly isolation our national shame in 2013. Still much more to do to tackle it &amp;each of us can play a part. #NoOneShouldHaveNoOne

Thanks to Dr Mike Jacobs &amp; team for dedication &amp; 1st class care; an amazing example of the life saving work that NHS performs day in day out
Delighted about Pauline Cafferkey's discharge from hospital. Incredibly courageous and selfless lady who has made NHS &amp; Britain proud.
Encouraging improvement in A&amp;E waits this week.Thanks to all A&amp;E staff working day&amp;night to give patients great care: http://t.co/nhZJU66Ynh
Some good sense from @leicesterliz: http://t.co/Nn2EB1zsdA
Thanks @andyburnhammp. Nice to enjoy a rare moment of consensus! Let's hope both our children can grow up in a smoke-free generation.
@TimesNewsdesk NHS under huge pressure but cancelled ops proportion is stable while no operations performed up 850k. http://t.co/9UxHzUIldg
Plain packaging has potential to save thousands of lives; this Gov is pressing ahead with it for the sake of the next generation's health
Also called on @andyburnhammp 2 put patients before unions &amp; condemn strike action that risks patient safety &amp; is backed by only 4% of staff
Politicians that care about patients are as outraged by problems in power as in opposition.We'll keep tackling poor care wherever we find it
Challenged @LabourHealth in opp day debate on their cynical stance on poor care: ignore Mid Staffs&amp;Wales then call crisis in England.
Hospitals treating record numbers of patients: http://t.co/DObH7s8PBT
Bruce also right on damage caused by calling crisis 'willy-nilly'. NHS staff doing amazing job rising to challenge of unprecedented demand.
Extra £2bn funding next year will help; long-term needs strong economy to fund community services expansion.
Agree with Sir Bruce Keogh in @guardian  interview on need for transformation in out of hospital care.
Another blow to privatisation myth: 400k fewer taking out private insurance since 2010.Big vote of confidence in NHS: http://t.co/u3vz6qHhmm
Excellent discussion about new models of care with Harrow CCG and @BobBlackmanMP and @HannahDavid_HW
Year-on-year fall in Dec A&amp;E performance more than 50% higher in Labour-run Wales than Eng. Makes "weaponising" in Eng all the more hollow.
@TheBMA join chorus of voices against "weaponising" of NHS for political purposes - "this issue goes beyond one party and one government".
81% of Welsh patients seen within 4hrs in Dec; 90%+ in Eng, yet Lab only say "crisis" in Eng. Will make Eng patients cynical and Welsh angry
Inspiring visit 2 Luton Hosp &amp; superbly run A &amp; E. Great commitment from staff &amp;close links with community services http://t.co/sXquK8AfvJ
Banning&amp;legislating not always the answer to pub health q.s on salt, sugar&amp;fat: backing families 2 make better choices brings lasting change
Huge public health progress has made since 2010: adult&amp;child obesity rates down; alcohol-related harm down; lowest ever smoking rates.
People see through attempts to make political capital out of NHS problems when they sweep poor care at Wales&amp;Mid Staffs under the carpet.
Shadow ministers taking every opportunity to weaponise at health q.s. No consideration of impact of disgraceful strategy on patients&amp;staff.
Very welcome news from @RoyalFreeNHS that Pauline Cafferkey's condition shows signs of improvement. Thoughts remain with her and her family.
We heard @andyburnhammp state on #r4today Labour ‘let the market in too far’ – @Ed_Miliband visiting an example of that today at the Lister?
@Ed_Miliband today visiting prime eg of Labour NHS lies: Lister Surgicentre services outsourced to private sector under Labour,causing chaos
A&amp;Es continued to face huge pressure this week.Appeal to everyone to get behind amazing NHS staff&amp;support their sterling efforts 4 patients.
This Gov makes no apology for seeking solutions for failing hospitals. We won't be deterred from tackling poor care &amp; driving up standards.
Disappointing news on Hinchingbrooke,but @andyburnhammp must stop playing politics - he signed off decision to allow private sector operator
Thoughts with the French at this tragic time. Freedom of press&amp;speech are precious national treasures that evil can never triumph over.
All UK nations run by 4 different political parties face pressure: time for better debate that supports staff&amp;puts patients before politics
Updated the commons on A&amp;E performance this afternoon. Labour's attempts to 'weaponise' NHS risk damaging morale at the worst possible time.
More A&amp;E facts: http://t.co/IPTNGIXczo
On average 2000 extra patients being seen in less than 4 hours each day compared to 2010: http://t.co/qL2XHfZDpz
Wrong @Ed_Miliband. More patients than ever being seen in &lt;4 hours. Strong NHS needs strong economy so Labour's deficit denial risk to NHS.
A&amp;E staff are busting a gut to give patients timely, safe care. Whole country should be proud&amp;grateful for all their efforts.
A&amp;Es facing unprecedented increase in demand: http://t.co/hHBLD1Hl1N
A few A&amp;E facts: http://t.co/KWVM9lGFYY
Targets matter but unlike before we won't force hospitals to meet them at any cost: safe&amp;compassionate care must always come first.
English A&amp;Es remain best in world on waiting times - thanks to brilliant work by NHS staff in challenging circs
Her brave&amp;generous spirit does UK proud; our thoughts are with her&amp;family. NHS pulling out all stops to give her 1st class care she deserves
Updated the Commons this afternoon on condition of Pauline Cafferkey, British nurse who contracted Ebola while volunteering in Sierra Leone.
Lab once again found out peddling tired privatisation myths to scare vulnerable ppl. Public deserve a better NHS debate ahead of election.
John Humphrys summed up @andyburnhammp approach perfectly on #r4today:'scaremongering at its worst, what politics should no longer be about'
The NHS as you know it: frontline staff numbers up by 13,000, with 7,000 fewer managers according to @HSCIC stats http://t.co/V9iOR6ymV2
The NHS as you know it: record highs in number who would feel safe in an NHS hospital, and think they'd be treated with dignity and respect.
The NHS as you know it: 600,000 dementia friends over the last four years. http://t.co/yEYi5Q8xOK
The NHS as you know it: £2 billion of additional funding for the frontline next year, backed by a strong economy. http://t.co/p8rxXtFcRr
The NHS as you know it: cancer survival rates improving to record highs backed by the Cancer Drugs Fund http://t.co/W6c9lW25zp
The NHS as you know it: research spending on dementia nearly doubled as we take the fight to a devastating disease http://t.co/1XRRAEOZGK
NHS independently rated as becoming top in world under this govt - thx 2 funding made possible by strong economy http://t.co/zOxUekh0BW
That's it 4 tonight but 2 recap NHS facts (not spin): more money, more staff, more operations...the NHS as you know it under this govt
The NHS as you know it: 100k staff trained in dementia awareness, 600k dementia friends and dementia research doubled http://t.co/fM2oboAFsO
The NHS as you know it: cancer tests up 51% compared to Lab &amp; 700,000 more treated 4 cancer this parliament http://t.co/3pQdmydPjY
The NHS as you know it: 850k more operations every year than under Lab, 13k more clinical staff &amp; rated top in world http://t.co/Pa7XJLLHOn
Thinking of Pauline C &amp; those working round the clock to try to save her. She is the best of the NHS and the NHS is now giving her its best

Heroic staff deserve praise 4 steady performance in face of huge demand - last thing they need is to be dragged into political football game
Labour run Wales, SNP run Scotland, DUP run NI A&amp;Es all under pressure yet @andyburnhammp intent on making English A&amp;E political football.
Winter will be tough but UK patients seen faster in A&amp;E than anywhere else in the world, backed by unprecedented 700m extra ££ from Gov.
Further progress - one-year cancer survival rates for England have increased to almost 70%, a record high @ons http://t.co/vS4H0R3dTO
Biggest NHS debate isn't privatisation or ££, but transparency over poor care.We will keep tackling failure&amp;driving up standards 4 patients.
This is the approach that let MidStaffs go unchecked for yrs: good news&amp;protecting reputations mattered more than poor care&amp;learning lessons
Astonishing that @andyburnhammp still thinks we shouldn't have uncovered the full scale of the Mid Staffs tragedy: http://t.co/BI4cFcAZJ2

I agree with Nick: “@adamboultonSKY: NC Andy Burnham is only Health Sec to have privatized a hospital.”
Eng on track to treat 3/4 mil more patients for cancer this parl v.s last, saving 12,000 lives a year. But more to do as I tell #BAC14 today
Is this about politics or because they believe it? If belief, why no fund in Wales,which sends 6500 to Eng for cancer treatment every year?
@andyburnhammp, 17 Oct, Times: Cancer Drugs Fund "good politics not good policy". Burnham today: "Increase CDF by £50m".
My letter to @andyburnhammp: let's debate facts instead of scaremongering with dodgy stats. http://t.co/5nkK6y8dbz
@SmallBizSatUK thinking back 2 when I set up my business 22 yrs ago, many mistakes but no regrets &amp; amazing fun, would recommend to anyone
NHS recommends exclusive breastfeeding. Mums, ignore @Nigel_Farage&amp;@ClaridgesHotel - no corners or covers needed #ostentatiousbreastfeeding
We owe it to patients&amp;families who suffered at Mid Staffs, Morecambe Bay, Basildon etc to revolutionise NHS care culture for good.
Targets important but getting safe and compassionate care in every English hospital/NHS org is my no 1 mission as Health Sec.
Spoke to @HealthFdn #THFsafety about NHS cause closest to my heart: patient safety.
@andyburnhammp these are organisations interested in patients not politics...you should take note
@andyburnhammp then why do @TheKingsFund @PatientsAssoc @NHSProviders et al welcome it as a £2bn investment?
Only irresponsible thing is Lab still trying to scare vulnerable people with NHS 'privatisation'' lies.
Let's not forget @andyburnhammp called our decision to increase NHS spending 'irresponsible'.
@Ed_Miliband Lesson of #AS14 is Lab Govt will never be able to fund NHS properly as you can't deliver strong economy needed to finance it.
That plan for the NHS was called a ‘big step forward’ by @TheKingsFund and welcomed by the NHS, including @nhsconfed @rcgp @NHSProviders
Our £2.7 billion package for the NHS shows Gvt.’s priorities – when we have extra money, we invest it in services that everyone depends on.
A strong NHS needs a strong economy – in Greece health was cut by 14%; in Portugal by 17% because they lost control of national finances.
#AS2014 – we’ve cut the deficit, so we can invest in the future of the NHS with an extra £1.7 billion for the frontline next year.

What @andyburnhammp won't tell you - Labour's plans won't raise a penny for the NHS in 15/16. See @guardian piece: http://t.co/UeMXCEVRoy
Labour says only way to put more money into NHS is a new homes tax, today shows only way is a strong economy which Labour never deliver

@MandyHollis3 @WeNurses @swayoung01 @JaneMCummings yes I have!
@Ed_Miliband apparently wants to "weaponise" health - sadly, Labour haven't learnt that when the NHS is all about politics, patients suffer.
Labour's 2004 GP contract reduced out of hours access - we are giving millions evening &amp; weekend GP appointments, reducing pressure on A&amp;E
. @andyburnhammp if parents have an unwell child needing medical attention, A&amp;E provides a trusted service.
On Cancer Drugs Fund @andyburnhammp has already argued "there's no evidence to say" it's sensible http://t.co/wNS5yzb4Ld
Seems clear from @andyburnhammp reaction Labour looking to abolish Cancer Drugs Fund - will worry the 60k patients &amp; families already helped
Lab talks about privatisation that ISN'T happening whilst still ignoring poor care that DID happen on their watch: politics before patients
Private sector share of NHS spend only up 1% since @andyburnhammp was Health Sec: http://t.co/pMuKGV2xWH
'Privatisation' debate is simply red herring to distract from Labour's record ignoring poor care.
Another day in Parliament, another eg of Labour putting politics before patients: http://t.co/cXAvYS6YFP

£10bn savings challenge tough so voters must ask which party has track record on efficiency to deliver it: http://t.co/IWUtPngaN5
With a more compassionate culture we're already seeing, the NHS can turn heads across the world as it blazes a trail for C21 healthcare.
Also set out 10 savings challenges we can help the NHS deliver, which could save £10bn by 2020. Want a new compact with NHS to act on this.
We also need to protect personal data as NHS gets the benefits of sharing - so Dame Fiona Caldicott will become the National Data Guardian.
Tech can be revolutionary in preventative care - in Airedale vulnerable older people can get health advice from a nurse through their TV.
2018 paperless NHS means you will only tell yr story once &amp; with consent, yr electronic health record will b available across system by 2020
So National Information Board plans personalised 21st century healthcare for whole NHS - with power of citizens caring about their health.
NHS has more world firsts than any other publicly funded health system, including 1st IVF baby, but needs to be better at adopting new tech.
So those 4 pillars - strong economy, transforming out of hospital care, harnessing innovation and value for money, changing NHS culture.
But as Forward View makes clear, the only way to grow £113bn NHS budget is ensuring we have an economy generating tax revenue to finance it.
I'm increasingly optimistic that together we can build a new compact across the NHS which achieves the £22bn of efficiencies and better care
I outlined the four pillars of this government's plan for the NHS - how we'll make a reality of the @NHSEngland Five Year Forward View.

Big changes this morning as we announce £5bn of pooled budgets joining up health and social care services through the Better Care Fund.
Our zero-tolerance approach is bringing about real improvements for patients – and saves money too, £22.5 million already.

That @andyburnhammp response proves Labour STILL haven’t learnt the lessons of Mid Staffs – they prefer good headlines to good care.
Robert Francis is clear that our emphasis on safety would detect care failures ‘much more quickly’ http://t.co/QbtBP5lQXS
As @DavidNichols0n - former NHS CE - said, "patients were not the centre of the way the system operated" under last Government.
In fact, NHS is becoming safer – 5 hospitals turned around through special measures – precisely because we have an independent inspectorate.
In response to @CareQualityComm State of Care, @andyburnhammp said the report proves the NHS is ‘simply not safe’ under this Gvt.
Main issue for Lab NHS pledges is deliverability: Portugal cut health budget by 17%, Greece by 14% because like Lab they forgot the deficit
Labour left us with worst cancer survival rates in W Europe so this parliament we're treating nearly 3/4 million more for cancer than last
Ultimately, the path to lower cost is the same as the path to safer care – that’s the right path for patients http://t.co/lN0QRlWRad
We have 6,000+ more nurses on wards and higher standards since 2010, but even safer care is better for patients and saves NHS money.
Independent report today suggests poor care costs up to £2.5 bn a year – particularly at a time of financial pressure, it’s a false economy.

That contract with @TheBMA will help GPs provide more proactive, personal care for their patients - an important step forward.
And today we've also announced a new GP contract with @TheBMA, which restores named GPs for everyone - abolished by Labour in 2004.
Talking today about improving GP access for millions following PM Challenge Fund pilots last year - pledging £100m new investment next year.
All this while seeing 50% more cancer patients now than 4 years ago – whatever Burnham says, the #NHS is doing better than ever.

Our Nursing Technology Fund has invested £30m on innovative technologies like those in @BMJ_Qual_Saf research, benefiting staff and patients
Great to see @BMJ_Qual_Saf research showing innovative use of technology helps nurses spend less time on paperwork, saving lives.
. @dwilliamsHSJ that £2.7 billion real terms rise is set out in DH annual accounts, p. 28 here https://t.co/86izIoMpq1
Spending actually went up £2.7bn in real terms last year alone. So Labour are promising significantly less than we have actually delivered.
Miliband says £2.5bn more for annual NHS budget, c. 2.2% real terms. We  DELIVERED 4.4% real terms increase - see IFS http://t.co/BhrdnwX1uq
We are putting £12.7 billion more into the #NHS this Parliament because we took the difficult decisions Labour opposed.
These improvements can’t be funded if you bankrupt the economy as the last Labour Government did.
The number of health visitors is up 28 per cent since the election, with 2,250 more in post, helping new families make the best start.
There are 6000 more doctors in the #NHS since 2010, which we can only afford by cutting Labour's waste and removing 20,000 managerial posts.
New @HSCIC stats show we have 6100 more nurses on our wards since the election – means more compassionate, safer care http://t.co/16XZwpHo5y
NHS is getting safer, despite Labour scaremongering. Bringing down number of MRSA cases by 55% has saved £22.5m – funding 101 nurses a year.
Zero-tolerance approach means reduction by 55% in the number of MRSA cases since 2010. Figs show a 23% decrease on same period last year.
Thanks to hard work of #NHS staff, new @PHE_uk figures show MRSA cases have more than halved under this Govt. https://t.co/Pugu97HIna
We have now brought back named GPs for the over 75s which were abolished by Labour in 2004

Watershed day. Hard for Health Sec to admit things go wrong, but I'm determined to see poor care rooted out. Transparency is disinfectant.
@EvanHD You asked David N this morning if politicians would bite bullets. The answer's yes: https://t.co/juMpu4LQu3
Grateful to Camilla Cavendish for excellent review on healthcare assistants. NHS must hire and train for compassion as well as competence.
Good to see A&amp;Es still performing well - latest figures show 97.4% of patients seen in under 4 hours. More to be done for long term though.
Huge thanks to @EvelinaLondon for hosting #NHS bday event. Great to meet inspiring staff, children and parents on the ward. #NHS65
Free healthcare is one of our greatest ever achievements.Thanks to 1.3m NHS staff whose values make us proud to be British - happy birthday!

New plans to make sure visitors pay for NHS care. Fairness for hard-working UK families paying 5k tax a year for NHS.https://t.co/4pB4IKCCIn
Extraordinary for Ed M to write op-ed on NHS "accountability" and make no mention of Mid Staffs or Morecambe Bay failures on Labour's watch
Terrific work by NHS England and surgeons to publish mortality data.  Transparency means power for patients. http://t.co/BvoB4Sjrwn

Great visit to Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle where they told me being able to see patient's GP record would be huge step forward
Pleased to receive CQC letter naming the individuals involved. Clear sign NHS is changing. We must have accountability throughout the system
Report on appalling events at Morecambe Bay highlights culture of secrecy and neglect that our overhauled inspection regime will confront.
Real consensus on the need for joining up health and social care – key to improved prevention and care for vulnerable older people. #kfthink
More today on our wonderful Health Heroes - surgeon, matron, driver, GP and nursing assistant. Each an inspiration. http://t.co/zkngRVJywb
Just watched harrowing Panorama on care home abuse - showed how vital whistleblowers are. Big job for new Chief Inspector of Social Care
Welcome today's CQC consultation on fundamental standards. We must ensure that post Mid-Staffs, everyone receives truly high quality care.
Dr Ronan Moran, helped wash and change clothes for recently deceased patient, inspiring role model for family doctors http://t.co/RcTwKlZOiJ
@drphilhammond I know and have said so in my speeches - read them!
@clarercgp I am sure freeing GPs to spend more time with frail elderly is critical part of solution &amp; also more GPs needed
@clarercgp @BobNottm who says?
Consensus growing on need to improve GP provision and primary care. New Imperial College data shows impact on A&amp;Es http://t.co/1HmKPAjYgP
Excellent contributions from all sides today in discussing future of children's heart surgery. Crucial for families that we get this right.
“@DHgovuk: Local variation in avoidable death rates revealed: http://t.co/eun8XysKS0” Shocking inequalities we can now see need addressing.
New tomorrow: local rankings for early causes of death. Some areas doing great things but some terrible disparities people have right to see

Good 2 c emerging consensus at NHS Confed conf that improving treatment of vulnerable older people inside &amp; outside hospital is vital

No confusion about our increase in NHS spending - 2012/13 will be £106.6 billion, up from £99.7bn in 2009-10. Real terms increase of £600m.
More to be done addressing long term pressures but today’s stats show A&amp;Es are performing well and meeting targets http://t.co/vitjcq0vso
In case being misled by 'neutral' 38Degrees e-petition, it IS NOT and WAS NEVER going to be Conservative policy to limit GP appointments.
Excellent contribution from @margotjamesmp: How to keep older people out of A &amp; E - and also improve their care http://t.co/qXuHhuxFGM
Pleased to support the crucial work of Dementia Awareness Week. See how you can help make a difference http://t.co/QD8EacUGGW #TalkDementia
Speaking @TheKingsFund this afternoon on the role of primary care in the 21st century and the importance of family doctors #kflead
Thanks to UCLH for a great visit. Particular thanks to Linda on reception and healthcare assistant Daniel for showing me the ropes.
Laurence Buckman concedes on Today things have got gradually worse in A &amp; E since 2004 contract change &amp; too much box ticking. I agree
More on the need to support A&amp;E and repair trust in our out-of-hours care, damaged by Labour's 2004 GP contract http://t.co/Ga3dTQPjpd
Labour's 2004 GP contract allowed 90% of GPs to opt out of out-of-hours care - complaints rose, confidence fell and A&amp;Es became overwhelmed
Spontaneous round of applause from WHO plenary #WHA66 when I mentioned this year UK hit 0.7% development spend target
Just had meeting with Margaret Chan, DG of WHO. Invited her to our Dementia Summit in London.
At World Health Assembly #WHA66 Just signed MoU with Indian Govt, to strengthen collaboration in health sector.
Just met inspiring matron &amp; senior nurses @kingscollegenhs making paperless wards a reality
@andyburnhammp 4m more going to A&amp;E every year since Labour's catastrophic mistake on GP contract - and you still think no connection?
Just finished helping out on reception at GP surgery in Wandsworth, thanks Debbie for looking after me
@andyburnhammp Last Govt failed to provide a credible alternative, preferring to throw money at hitting 4hr target
@andyburnhammp 2001-2009 admissions up by 1% in Sweden.  UK was 36%.  Why?
Just attended excellent meeting on early intervention organised by Graham Allen MP - lots of interest in joint commissioning 4 young ppl
Publishing plan 4 vulnerable older people in autumn. Need 2 provide better alternatives to A&amp;E 4 older ppl with LTCs http://t.co/7bzTqwgGM3
Just manned the phones at the Hurley Clinic in Kennington, constant pressure from callers needing app'tments, thx to all 4 looking after me
2.9m people will have 3 or more long-term conditions by 2018. Need radical rethink of how we support the frail &amp; elderly with complex needs.
Just leaving to spend time in Lambeth GP surgery and discuss challenges facing primary care provision
c.70% of GPs use IT systems which can book appts&amp;order prescriptions online,but only c.30% offer this-if more did, much more time freed up
Superb local campaigning by SW Surrey Conservatives, esp Cllr Denise Le Gal, looks like it has stopped UKIP winning a single seat here
@benatipsosmori Agree-that's why we're doubling research funds, pushing for better diagnosis rates and want everyone to be a #dementiafriend
How well does your local area deal with 5 biggest causes of under75 mortality? Planning to make access to such crucial data a reality v.soon
A single moment of recognition gives you a year of hope - moving account I have just heard about caring for someone with Alzheimers
We would be delighted to meet with the BMA to discuss this further and very much hope they will choose to be part of the solution
Just arriving in Bristol for dementia conference. Great work on integrated care here by Rethink  and Dementia Friendly Parishes

Just did dementia speech debunking idea there's no point in early diagnosis: medicine, good care and lifestyle changes can all slow onset
@hammersley1965 please email me on huntj@parliament.uk
Average length of stay for emergency admissions is 9 days. For those with dementia, it's 28 days - too long.
Looking forward to meeting Don Berwick tomorrow to discuss his crucial work on achieving harm-free care throughout the NHS
Must admit planned trip before last week's momentous event but somehow seems fitting to be here
Just paying homage to Mrs T in my own way...a visit to Bruges
#healthwatch launch. Thanks for having me. It's time to learn from patients and make sure their voices are heard.
At least £1 in every £8 spent on long-term conditions is linked to poor mental health&amp;wellbeing. Desperately need parity of esteem
Tragic sad day but Lady T also reminds us of what politics can be at its best - turning things round against all the odds
Just had meeting with CQC Chair David Prior to discuss role of new Chief Inspector of Hospitals. Will be transformational.
Just done an intentional nursing round in Salford Royal elderly ward &amp; been helping dementia patients eat lunch - superb caring team here
Spent part of last night at St Thomas' A&amp;E. Real commitment from great staff who highlighted lack of availability of mental health services
We can't afford to ignore those with dementia - the financial cost of dementia to the UK was over £23 billion in 2012
See our initial response to Mid Staffs Inquiry - http://t.co/EscYQ4g5uB  - to put patients at the heart of a compassionate NHS
Determined to crackdown on abuse of #NHS. It's a national not international service &amp; only those who have right to free access should get it
10 million adults,1.3 million children in England are obese-among the worst in Europe. Need national &amp; local action to turn this around.
Continuing talks on Govt response to Francis Report. Pleased that all DH Ministers &amp; staff will be getting real experience on NHS frontline.
Nothing from Labour in today's NHS debate shows any recognition of catastrophic policy mistakes that led to Mid Staffs. Tragic complacency
40 communities across Britain want to be dementia friendly so far - double what we hoped #dementiachallenge
About to speak in Manchester Conference on dementia - diagnosis rate 49% in NW which is higher than national avg but still need 2 do better
David Nicholson has apologised, now Labour must too. My ConHome article here http://t.co/Vy5EXzrJVx
@DanHannanMEP good motto Dan for the NHS facing it's current challenges
We want more info, more data public on quality of outcomes in our hospitals - spoke  to Mike Richards workshop today on making this happen
Here's the speech I made at Reform yesterday on how the NHS can free up more time to care:  https://t.co/BDRl97Tq
About to give speech to Reform saying compassionate care needs less bureaucracy in the NHS - especially on front line
Good discussion with my team this morn on Francis recommendations. Will set out thoughts on tackling NHS bureaucracy @reformthinktank tomoro
Moving words by PM on Mid-Staffs tragedy - my challenge is 2 be able 2 look Stafford families in eye &amp; say I've turned words into action
@NVTweeting @leicesterliz The F&amp;F test will have a free text box so patients can give specific feedback, essential to improve services
@NVTweeting @leicesterliz LGA contacted all 152 councils on 10/01/13, 95% said they'll have an operational service in place by April '13
Good to see so many at Parliamentary reception on dementia. Real momentum for improving care for those who need it.
