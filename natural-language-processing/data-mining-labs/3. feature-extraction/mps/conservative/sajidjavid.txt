Finally, one thing I had to repeatedly make clear: THERE WILL BE NO SECOND REFERENDUM. Deeply unhelpful of some UK figures to travel around raising this prospect while so many working hard to land a deal.
Same for citizens‚Äô rights. We have made it clear that, deal or no deal, EU citizens in UK can stay.  And we expect our neighbours to communicate the same to UK citizens in their countries.
First, security cooperation is not a zero-sum game - it‚Äôs a win-win. Keeping our citizens safe should not be a bargaining chip. UK is unconditionally committed to European security.
At Berlin airport after a 2 days in Spain and Germany where I gave a speech on security cooperation, and met with counterparts, thinktanks &amp; MPs. Three thoughts‚Ä¶

Agreed on importance of citizens‚Äô rights with my Spanish counterpart. Deal or no deal, need to reassure Brits in Spain &amp; Spaniards in UK that they will be able to stay and their rights protected. We have already promised this for Spaniards in the UK
Great to speak at influential @EFEnoticias policy forum in Madrid. My message is simple: the UK remains committed to it‚Äôs security partnership with Spain and all other EU friends https://t.co/ifxOPGHMW3

It‚Äôs a despicable, inhumane, uncivilised practice that has no place whatsoever in Britain.
Despite excellent Government work since 2010 combating forced marriage, @thetimes absolutely right to highlight that more needs to be done.

Some see the CU as some kind of post-Brexit comfort blanket. But they're only thinking about the past referendum, not the UK's future. Let's look forwards with confidence.
British people gave politicians clear instructions through EU referendum. Includes leaving the Customs Union, an intrinsic part of the EU. Britain must leave CU and be able to negotiate &amp; sign own trade deals https://t.co/9jUlNaWPMt

@jeremycorbyn @theresa_may @Conservatives The truth is, you showed that antisemitism has a warm home in Labour. Shame on you
Sadly, given Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs chuntering, heckling &amp; general daze, and pathetic response from Diane Abbott, not a scintilla of doubt in my mind that he plans to do nothing about surge in antisemitism under his leadership. A sad day for a party with a proud history fighting racism
Today I attended the most moving debate I have ever seen in Parliament. Colleague after colleague condemned antisemitism in all its forms, with passionate contributions in particular from Luciana Berger, Ruth Smeeth, Robert Halfon, John Mann &amp; Ian Austin
Another big day in Parliament today with first General Debate on antisemitism. Sincerely hoping @jeremycorbyn will make time to at least listen to, if not speak about, this important issue #EnoughisEnough
This April, nearly 3,500 people will be diagnosed with #bowelcancer &amp; 1,300 people will die. Help @Bowel_Cancer_UK &amp; @bowelcancer ensure more people survive the UK's 2nd biggest cancer killer #BowelCancerAwarenessMonth
I‚Äôm deeply concerned to hear about difficulties some of the Windrush generation are facing with their immigration status. This should not happen to people who have been longstanding pillars of our community. The government is looking into this urgently

So, Corbyn sacks Chris Williamson MP for being honest about Labour plans to double council tax - but not for making anti-semitic comments. Tells you all you need to know about Labour https://t.co/aYusRs9pO5
You‚Äôre right @philipfowler. I was impressed by Finland‚Äôs Housing First approach in doing just that. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre piloting it in 3 English regions. Must do all we can to tackle homelessness https://t.co/C1hue5uTCT
@HomesEngland I‚Äôm determined to build the homes our country needs - @HomesEngland will be at heart of leading this effort; building a Britain fit for the future

Our economy collapsed under Labour (as usual), giving us deepest recession in 100 yrs, largest peacetime budget deficit &amp; world‚Äôs biggest bank bailout.   Grown over 16% since 2010, and IMF forecasts we will grow faster this year than France, Italy &amp; Japan. https://t.co/bi1i7S7Crr

Great UK economic news to start the year:  - Top European destination in 2017 for tech investment, more than Germany, France, Spain &amp; Ireland combined @CityAM   - Largest quarterly rise in labour productivity in 7 years @ONS   More to do, but very encouraging   #Conservatives
Investment in UK‚Äôs tech sector almost doubled in 2017 - a huge vote of confidence in British industry. More to do, but welcome boost to jobs @CityAM https://t.co/mSua6qX9wg
Last Labour govt left UK with deepest peacetime recession in 100 yrs.   The one before that went cap in hand to the IMF for a bailout.   At least @AngelaRayner admits Labour has learned absolutely nothing.   Same old Labour.   https://t.co/2QJ7AuzauE
@thepublicgets Already more council houses built during 7 years of Conservative govt versus 13 years of Labour
Actually, under 13 years of Labour rule social homes for rent FELL by 410,000 units. Since 2010, affordable homes for rent up by more than 240,000. More to do, but making solid progress after massive Labour fail https://t.co/oYeidigo9r
Homelessness peaked under LABOUR in 2003 (after 6 years in office!). Since then, down by more that 50%. A lot more to do, yes. But your assertion is simply false https://t.co/GgiXtW9k5L
Labour gave us lowest level of annual house building in almost 100 years when last in office.   Out of office, they vote against a stamp duty cut for 80% of first-time buyers.   Same old Labour. https://t.co/Oy21TnROdE
@Wychebrook @theresa_may Fair point Wyn. Still too many people struggling to buy own home. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre doing all we can to make sure more houses being built in right places. And helping with finances, with things like the stamp duty cut

What almost every recent Labour MP thinks of Jeremy Corbyn: #BBCDebate https://t.co/9nMtLU7ca1
172 of Corbyn's OWN MPs had no confidence in him.  Says it all #BBCDebate
@DavidGauke He's voted against EVERY piece of anti-terror legislation since 1983!

Labour's high tax, high debt policy cocktail will hit the living standards of every family across the UK #BBCDebate

Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn will be PM - there's no other choice #BBCdebate
