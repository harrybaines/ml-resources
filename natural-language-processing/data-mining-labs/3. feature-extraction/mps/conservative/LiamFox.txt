(2/2) The best way to avoid no deal is to vote for the Prime Minister's deal.  I support and voted for the PM's deal, I hope others take a pragmatic approach too.
(1/2) I have been clear that it is in everyone’s interests to reach a deal. I want the UK to leave with a deal. However, it is only responsible for Govt, to ensure that the country is prepared for a range of outcomes including the possibility no deal - which we all want to avoid.

I will support the Prime Minister @theresa_may tonight. This is a totally inappropriate time to have a contest. The country expects us to provide stability not damaging division.
I welcome NZ Trade Minister @DavidParkerMP's comments in @thetimes today that he is really keen to strengthen economic ties. We'll be able to negotiate, sign and ratify new trade agreements after Brexit.
(3/3) “We will implement our own trade remedies regime, protecting jobs and livelihoods, set our own tariffs to allow us to do agreements around the world, and take up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation.” https://t.co/YjWOraYOGj
(2/3) “The withdrawal agreement means that we will be free to decide for ourselves who comes to the UK. Free to decide who fishes in our waters. Free to decide how to support our farmers. Free to open new markets around the world to the best that Britain produces.”
(1/3) Here's what I said to MPs in the @HouseofCommons on the third day of debate:   “The withdrawal agreement provides the stability, continuity and certainty that businesses want, as well as a firm platform to continue to operate across the EU and with our global partners.”
Fantastic to see new @HMRCpressoffice figures today showing a 1.5% increase in exported goods from the UK compared with the same quarter in the previous year. The average value of goods exported in the UK per exporter was £0.8m #ExportingisGREAT https://t.co/9dMUDC5k7x

… and of course, I was asked about food standards again. Our position hasn’t and won’t change. British produce is famous precisely because of its high quality. Lowering standards would make no sense, and so we will not do it.
I informed the committee that the UK's services schedule has now been submitted to @WTO. This follows the goods schedule submitted earlier this year and recent support for UK’s independent membership of GPA. All important milestones as UK prepares to take an independent seat.
I highlighted the latest statistics released by @ONS yesterday which showed the value of the UK’s FDI stocks as a whole increased by £12.6% (£149 billion) to £1,337 billion in 2017: https://t.co/wY4aoAFRN8 #InvestInGREAT

The divisions of the referendum need to be consigned to the past. Now is the time to set aside our differences, and lead our country to a future of freedom, success, and prosperity.
In April, when we become an independent trading nation once more, I will push for 3 things: revolutionising the rules on digital trade, putting the UK's world-leading services at the heart of our trade agenda, and working alongside European partners to promote free &amp; open trade.
Last year, the UK tech sector attracted more venture capital investment than Sweden, France, and Germany combined. In the knowledge economy, Britain’s shelves are already stacked with what the world wants to buy.
If we want Britain to become a global exporting superpower, we have to unlock our considerable potential. Our new Export Strategy, published in August, is an important first step to doing just that. #ExportingIsGREAT https://t.co/4PkmuITOVF
We have set out an approach which means the UK would be able to set its own trade policy with the rest of the world, including setting our own tariffs, implementing our own trade remedies, and taking up our independent seat at the World Trade Organisation. #FreeTradeUK
The political declaration proposes the creation of a free trade area for goods, combining deep regulatory and customs co-operation with no tariffs, no fees, charges or quantitative restrictions across all goods sectors.
The withdrawal agreement and the political declaration provide the stability and certainty that businesses crave, as well as a firm foundation on which to continue to operate across the EU.
This morning I spoke to port workers @BristolPort, I made it clear that now is the time to raise our sights, and acknowledge that there is a world beyond Europe, and a time beyond Brexit. #FreeTradeUK

Have experienced some of the best of Israeli Innovation at @PeresCenter - great to hear the story of Israel and how it became a start-up nation #InnovationIsGREAT https://t.co/NGWFiX8hZo
(2/2) We've been very clear that the UK will have an independent trade policy covering all aspects of goods and services, that we will be able to set our own tariffs, and we will be able to negotiate, sign and ratify new free trade agreements after we leave the EU on 29 March.
(1/2) Trade between the US and the UK is worth more than £180bn and accounts for a fifth of all UK exports. We have more than a trillion dollars invested in each other’s economies. This is one of the most successful trade and investment relationships in the world.
Pleased to see support today for 🇬🇧's accession to the Government Procurement Agreement as an independent member. The UK’s continued membership will ensure fair and open competition amongst all parties in overseas procurement markets worth more than £1.3tn annually. https://t.co/bwNNF0uNsb
Great to start my first day in Israel by meeting some of the UK’s biggest Israeli investors. Since the 2016 referendum, there has been £400 million of Israeli investment in the UK, creating 1,300 jobs across the country. #InvestInGREAT #FreeTrade https://t.co/NMz6IoqIBP

Every month @tradegovuk meets with MPs from all parties to talk about the work my department is doing. Today we discussed how we are boosting UK exports - which have grown by £111 billion since the referendum - through our new Export Strategy #ExportingIsGREAT https://t.co/5uFKMX7tij
Plus one extra stat on investment - recent @UNCTAD figures showed that in the first half of this year the UK was the 2nd top global destination for investment, ahead of the USA, and the number 1 European destination. https://t.co/SXER4w6Gkb
Since the referendum we have increased our exports by £111bn. This confounds the prophets of doom who predicted such dire consequences for our economy if we voted to leave the EU. https://t.co/4UDEGmvs54
As growth in exports continue to outstrip growth in imports the UK's trade deficit has shrunk from £23.4bn to £15.8bn (year to Sep 2018). It's important that this success of entrepreneurial UK firms is not lost in the politicised media focus on Brexit. https://t.co/Knkolu7A2u
Recent @HMRCgovuk figures confirm that exports of goods have shown robust growth in every region of the UK. This comes on top of the whole year figure for 2017 where exports in goods + services grew by &gt;10%. https://t.co/8ETSj92ssm

Delighted to receive our trees from the @WoodlandTrust @QueensCanopy - potted up ready to be planted out at @ClevedonSchool in support of project Xenia https://t.co/q7nSEZAy3x
(3/3) After March 2019 the UK will be able to trade on its provisional schedules even if they are not certified, and use them to help mitigate the impact of no deal, should that be necessary.
(2/3) Indeed, the EU is currently trading on uncertified schedules, and has been doing so for most of its membership of the @wto, because of its successive enlargements.
(1/3) There is a misunderstanding, sometime wilful, how the @wto works. WTO members are able to trade on uncertified schedules in the WTO as they complete processes like the Article XXVIII negotiations the UK announced this week.

The political elite told us in 1975 there would be no loss of sovereignty. It was a blatant lie. If we remain we would lose even more.#EUref
Europe and the EU are not the same. One is a great continent of nation states,the other a short-term,self-serving political construct #EUref

Interview on @daily_politics with @afneil discussing #EUreferendum #Brexit #scc16 https://t.co/PLciVgksb6
"It’s time to take control. It’s time to go" #scc16
"secure in the knowledge of what our people can achieve together, more open to the wider world and the exciting future it offers" #scc16
"It is time for us to embrace the future with pride and confidence" #scc16
"We’ve seen the deal. We know what awaits us if we remain..." #scc16
"That is money that would be better spent in Britain – in every part of Britain" #scc16
"On top of all of this we are subsidising the whole process to the tune of £55 million per day" #scc16
"We didn’t ask for any change to the free movement of people and so we will continue to have mass migration from the European Union" #scc16
"The European Court still has the final say on our laws so we cannot escape from the concept of ever closer union" #scc16
"We didn’t get control of our own law-making and achieved no treaty change" #scc16
"But the simple truth is that our EU partners have no intention of undertaking the fundamental review" #scc16
"I have no doubt about the sincerity or commitment that the Prime Minister showed to the process" @David_Cameron @Number10gov #scc16
"I never believed that the recent so-called renegotiation would achieve much" #scc16
"...Europe less relevant in a global context and condemned millions of its citizens to unnecessary unemployment and hardship" #scc16
"the European Union never fully understood the implications of the fall of the Berlin Wall or the new world that it ushered in" #scc16
"...and the administration of the Brussels bureaucracy do not understand our country or its history" #scc16
"Those who are intent on talking Britain down and telling us that we can’t cope without the institutions of the EU..." #scc16
"we were able to save the European continent twice in the twentieth century from their own folly" #scc16
"This is no isolation.This is no leap in the dark.This country has never been isolated, but what we have been is proud &amp; independent &amp; free"
"We will still be one of the key players in NATO, with a special relationship with the United States" #scc16
"We will still have the world’s fifth biggest defence budget. We will still be members of the G7 and the G 20" #scc16
"We will still be at the heart of the Commonwealth. We will still be one of the world’s top 10 economies" #scc16
"If we leave the EU, we will still have a permanent seat on the Security Council of the UN" #scc16
"Nothing could be further from the truth" #SCC16
"So the next thing that they want to peddle is that if Britain leaves the European Union we will become isolated" #scc16
"President Roosevelt said back in 1933 that we "have nothing to fear but fear itself." It's just as true today" #scc16
It is sad but unsurprising that those that want the British to be kept in the European Union have launched what they call Project Fear
"That claim lies at the unhappy conjunction of the Scot nationalists and the Remain camp, an unholy alliance if ever there was one" #scc16
"No, I simply do not believe that a vote to leave the EU will inevitably lead to the breakup" #scc16
"In any case, any case made for Scottish independence, were we to leave the EU would be taken against a very different backdrop" #scc16
"with equal weight being given to each and every one" #scc16
"It is a decision for the whole of the UK made by all citizens of the UK" #scc16
"and our freedom to determine our own laws" #scc16
"A decision of this magnitude for the country needs to be taken on the big issues about our place in the world" #scc16
"locked into ever closer union in the EU with the Union imperilled anyway" #scc16
