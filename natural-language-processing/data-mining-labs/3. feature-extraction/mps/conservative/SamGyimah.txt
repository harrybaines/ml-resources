Bank of America, Barclays, Nissan, Honda, Panasonic, P&amp;O, JLR...have in the last few weeks made decisions that are unfavourable to the UK. Whether you voted leave or remain, there is a big question as to how we demonstrate that the UK is open for business.
Failure to level with the public on the trade offs &amp; costs of the Brexit options is a big political problem. Denying that Brexit is a key factor in the growing number of businesses leaving the UK is a manifestation of the problem. We cannot gloss over issues impacting livelihoods
Great work by @CommonsCMS. The idea that the web should be beyond careful regulation is long past its sell by date.

@david_colquhoun @toadmeister Theresa May is not part of the problem. She is part of the solution. The gov‚Äôt has made great progress in dealing with threats to the environment and climate change.  Still a long way to go, but this is the case we should be making today.
@toadmeister I don‚Äôt condone all they are doing. But I think the mature way to win people over is to engage positively with their concerns and disabuse them of their false assumptions. If we don‚Äôt do that and the opposition do it, we‚Äôll have ourselves to blame if they never vote for us.
@HomeboyHotel That‚Äôs not the point. I thought you do things because they are the right thing to do. And then you try to take people along with you. But what would I know!

Lots of focus on the backstop.  But there lots of major flaws with the PMs deal - fails to reset our relationship with the EU, which is what the Brexit vote called for. If the deal passes, post 29th Mar, we will have the same arguments but from a significantly weakened psn.

There are some who hope voters will blame Brussels, not HMG, if there are no concessions on the backstop. Doubt this will work, and even if it does, it is a terrible basis for negotiating the amazing FTA those same people hope to negotiate with the EU. Time for us to get real!
Lots of focus on the Backstop. But what exactly will we asking Brussels to replace it with. Yes, it is inconvenient &amp; existential for us, but we can‚Äôt wish away the fact that Ireland is the EU‚Äôs external frontier &amp; we have a binding obligation to Ireland to keep an open border.
I voted in favour of backbench amendments that ruled out No Deal. Pleased that Caroline Spelman's amendment passed. Sends a clear message that there is a majority against No Deal. I abstained on the Brady Amendment- it raises expectations on the Backstop that cannot be delivered.
Thoughts on imaginative Malthouse proposal: 1. Accepts exit payment + transition 2. New backstop protocol unclear  3. If based on Canada FTA, then no open border in NI 4. Farming &amp; manufacturing will take a big hit under WTO tariffs 5. Suspect Art 50 extension needed to negotiate

@seanjcoughlan Of course, you would implement with restrictions. It's the principle I'm arguing for at this stage
Theresa May‚Äôs Deal united leavers &amp; remainers against it. The backstop is not the only problem. Jacob Rees-Mogg, put it well: the deal makes the UK a vassal state. If this is the choice we face for our future, then we should not ram it through. Let the people have a final say.

The Gov‚Äôt is paralysed when we need to debate all the Brexit options - including Plan A+ beloved of Brexiteers. Fuss about MPs taking control will die down, if govt facilitates debate, rather than pretending nothing has changed since its Brexit plan was heavily defeated.
@barry_ridler @Snitchie @heidiallen75 Absolutely. Change is not always bad. You just need to level with people so they go in with their eyes wide open. The offer -of easy trade deals - in the referendum is not what you are arguing for now.
A GE cannot resolve deadlock in because Brexit is not a party political issue. There are many flavours of Brexit, hence impasse in parliament. Better to let the people decide on their Brexit than to have an establishment stitch up which will leave many betrayed.
A General Election in which neither main party has a settled Brexit policy that its MPs and members are united behind, will resolve nothing. Better to let the people back into the process with a #finalsay in a new referendum. https://t.co/EI1Edq2Fq4

Our objective at this critical time should be to safeguard our country from the many risks we face. A process to deliver consensus in the House of Commons is necessary. The option of letting the people back into the process in a new referendum should be firmly on the table.
We've needlessly wasted 5 weeks since the MV was delayed.  If deal is voted down, the wrong approach would be to seek cosmetic changes to the flawed deal that change nothing, or changes that are non-negotiable with the EU. We'll need a whole new approach. https://t.co/ltmllpCAH1

@dmck52 @DPJHodges Not at all. I'll be voting against the WA myself.
@DPJHodges True. But neo-nazi thugs have no interest in our democratic process. And they will hijack any grievance to advance aims that are beyond the pale politically. Brexit is a complex issue, you can't simplify. We must deny them the space to use it. We must at all times condemn
@DPJHodges Sadly the betrayal narrative is already out there. That‚Äôs is why we should level with people on the tough trade-offs inherent in delivering Brexit, otherwise this deal will go through and different sections of the public will feel betrayed because they didn‚Äôt get their Brexit.
@DPJHodges You make a powerful point. Re the Grayling comment, the question is which version of Brexit would be acceptable to the far right, as some of them believe the May deal is a Remain stitch up.
How we conduct ourselves as MPs &amp; what we say at this juncture is critical. Heightening fear through raising the spectre of the far right is unacceptable. If we level with people about the tough trade-offs we face in delivering Brexit, the far right will be on barren ground. https://t.co/5u1rL4q13n

@Starcourse We are in this situation  because we've boxed ourselves in, and now the PM is inflexibly pushing her flawed deal whilst expecting Parliament to be flexible. That's not a recipe for concensus when the gov't has no majority.
Quit day job &amp; plan for no‚Äëdeal, thousands of civil servants told. Most gov‚Äôt depts will only be fulfilling a care &amp; maintenance function. This is not normal! We are doing this to ourselves and not in response to an external threat. Huge opportunity cost.  https://t.co/L21QkeN2wi
@NSoames is right. Brexit is a national project, not a party political project, and should have been treated as such from day 1. A gov‚Äôt with no majority cannot solve Brexit on it‚Äôs own.   Breaking the deadlock in parliament &amp; building consensus requires cross-party cooperation. https://t.co/FyVFEqL06x
@dansabbagh Is this effectively an admission that after two years of negotiations and delaying the MV for five weeks, Downing St astonishingly does not have a plan B on the biggest issue facing the country
Jeremy Corbyn‚Äôs call for a GE is about his single-minded pursuit of a Marxist Utopia. He‚Äôs gambling that chaos will help deliver this. So Lab. is absent from the field on the most important issue to face the country in a generation. An opposition in hiding is not ready for gov‚Äôt
@andrew_lilico It‚Äôs time you spelt out what the No Deal plan is, other than just saying ‚Äòwe can do it‚Äô.
Forging a path together in the national interest is what politicians should do to resolve Brexit. But the amendments on Workers Rights do not alter the fact that Theresa May‚Äôs Deal is practically and politically undeliverable and risks the Union
The Prime Minister announced her Brexit deal with the words 'let's get on with it'. The Grieve amendment requiring the Govt to table a Plan B within 3 days if it loses the MV ensures precisely that.
Great to see the #NHSLongTermPlan providing more perinatal mental health support for mothers and their partners ‚Äì an issue @salhogg @NCTcharity and I have been campaigning for in East Surrey. Support during this time is so crucial.

@markbishopuk @CosimadiRonda The 2017 manifesto lost us 28 seats (including Kensington) and cost us our majority. The public's response to the Brexit general election wasn't to give us a larger majority but to return a hung parliament. That is why parliament is deadlocked. There's no conspiracy.
@veronicanew3 @DCBMEP I'm not saying it can't be done. I'm saying we can't drift into a chaotic exit.
@markbishopuk @DaveFernig @PropertySpot True. How would you deal with risk of smuggling?
@DCBMEP You may be right. My point is about changing a 45 year trading arrangement with no plan, including a plan for services which form 80% of our economy. If WTO on it's own was satisfactory, we wouldn't need trade deals.
It's 81 days to Brexit and we've been negotiating with the EU for 2 yrs, they  know what our negotiating hand looks like. And secrecy would not improve it either. Lesson of last two years is we've been secretive and ended up with a deal neither leavers nor remainers like. https://t.co/QR6Ytj6ANO
Remainers care as much about the country as Leavers do. Drifting into No Deal is a big deal, it's never been done before. WTO is a slogan but what's the actual short and long term plan. I haven't seen one. Having parliamentary scrutiny can therefore only be a good thing. https://t.co/Uevv6aDXi0
Openess, transparency, democratic accountability to parliament and the people, are key aspects of our political system. The Brexit process, like all other policy areas, benefits from this approach.  #financebill
@markbishopuk It does not block funding. The govt will have to give Parliament a vote if it chose to use those specific powers, so it puts safeguards in place against drifting to a chaotic exit.
This is a big decision for the country. The amendment does not impede the govt from pursuing its policy. It requires the govt to engage with parliament. I don‚Äôt see how that is anti-democratic. https://t.co/FAJ7xTzoVV
@HfromHorley @YvetteCooperMP @ToryHorley The amendment does not stop the gov‚Äôt pursuing its policy. It requires the govt to engage with parliament. Parliantary accountability is healthy for our democracy.
Today I voted against the gov‚Äôt for the first time. I did so to send a message that crashing out of the EU is unconscionable. We need greater transparency and engagement with parliament on No Deal planning. This amendment makes that happen
...And Corbyn‚Äôs Labour Party is not a Government in waiting, but an Opposition in hiding. https://t.co/E1GzW2gSih

Insightful thread on our Brexit predicament. https://t.co/Wqfmp2LQ5f
In this crisis of our democracy, my answer is that there should be more democracy not less.
I share the fear and anxieties of many because referendums are rare in the UK and the last one was a singular traumatic event.
The betrayal narrative has become the new Project Fear, whatever the Brexit path a significant portion of the public will feel betrayed.
The strange thing is that those who say the public is ready to take to the streets are the same people who say the public are bored of Brexit and want to move on.
In public life we sometimes have to face difficult choices, and if we cannot honestly recommend any of the deals in front of us, we must have the courage to call a halt.
Rather than giving Parliament a false choice, we should think the unthinkable and consider extending A50 and a new referendum to break the deadlock in Parliament.
There is no easy way of delivering Brexit ‚Äì all the different brands of No Deal are slogans only, they are not plans on which our country can base its future.
The backstop is one of lots of deal-breakers with the PM‚Äôs deal ‚Äì at its heart we will go from a country that ranks on a par with France/Germany to a nation of lobbyists‚Ä¶it is not in our national interest.
Jeremy Corbyn is a life-long Brexiteer and has no plan, he is playing the Labour Party for fools - Labour is not a Govt in waiting but an Opposition in hiding.
Everything has been done by the Establishment to protect Brexit from any kind of scrutiny, whether from the Courts, Parliament or the British people.
Our negotiating objectives were shrouded in secrecy to keep the realities of Brexit from the people.
As Parliament returns, the Establishment must come clean on Brexit ‚Äì there‚Äôs never been an attempt to level with the public on the difficult choices and complex trade-offs in delivering it‚Ä¶speech thread.
As Parliament returns, it‚Äôs time for the Establishment to come clean on Brexit - my speech today on the way forward.   https://t.co/F2qKNNq3dG

Taking back control means the freedom to diverge and once you have say two different customs and regulatory regimes on EU/UK side you‚Äôll need a legal border. That‚Äôs why nations have a border force, customs officers etc, which is why I can‚Äôt see how you do away with the backstop. https://t.co/iXhz41ZVJh
The PM has said there can be no deal without a backstop, and she is right. Taking back control of our borders &amp; not expecting the other side to have a border, is a contradiction. The backstop is a legal way of kicking this can down the road, which is why it cannot be removed. https://t.co/rIDTCaOgYH

@instadangan No. Artificial Intelligence, Quantum, Genomics, Space....
The best innovation and creativity comes from our talented people working with the best from around. This is why we punch above our weight in science, tech &amp; innovation. Many of these people have other options, so we risk sacrificing a huge competitive advantage with this policy.
To lead the world in the industries of the future, our action must match our ambition. ¬£30k salary threshold  would severely restrict the number of talented young researchers, scientists and innovators who can deploy their talents here for the good of our country. Self-defeating!
Businesses are being asked to prepare for No Deal. I'm genuinely not clear what this means. Does this mean businesses preparing not to be able to trade.
Negotiations on the NI backstop are not ongoing. https://t.co/AdvDyuILJX
Insightful. https://t.co/LHbNvYKAwY
The key issue for Parliament today is not whether a 2nd Referendum is a good idea or whether we should have indicative votes on all the alternative options. We need a vote on the govt's plan. Without resolution on the May plan, we are stuck, and the clock is ticking.
Downing St has stopped selling the PMs flawed deal. Instead we have displacement activity designed to distract from last weeks failed renegotiation. And a concerted attempt to discredit every plausible alternative as they run down the clock. This is not in the national interest.
It would be extraordinary and deeply irresponsible for the government  not to consider every policy option available to it at this critical time. Surely, that's the duty of government. https://t.co/ph5rkhvDt7
On Indicative Votes:  1. Will have to be a free vote 2. Options &amp; propositions need cross party agreement  3. Requires careful planning 4. Gov't will have to be bound by result 5. Will have to take place after vote on PMs deal All of this put pressure on the timetable.
@markbishopuk @DouglasCarswell @EastSurreyCons I am saying if deadlock persists after having explored all the alternatives this we should seriously consider this as that is where the logic takes us. It is not something I want per se.
To be clear, conversations are covering all the options and with MPs across the House. Given deadlock in parliament, it would be irresponsible for ministers not to reflect on which options would get through parliament. https://t.co/jkVhjDROuR

@DouglasCarswell @DouglasCarswell whatever one's view of the way forward, it makes sense to get on with that vote. It was the PM who said 'let's get on with it', afterall. Wasting time and increasing uncertainty at this critical stage cannot be in the national interest.
Important to be clear that No Deal could mean planning for the UK to crash out OR an arranged No Deal, which means a negotiated deal with the EU not to have a deal. This path, like all others, requires significant legislation, an objectively assessed plan &amp; goodwill on both sides https://t.co/D6A94yvPyg

There is no point in delaying the MV till after Christmas, now we know the EU will not renegotiate. Less time to agree plan B, more uncertainty, and business + gov‚Äôt will need to activate v. expensive contingency plans. Running down the clock is a reckless strategy
The backstop is only one of a number of issues with the PM‚Äôs deal. Sovereignty is a key concern for many leavers and remainers. We become a rule taker rather than a rule maker and the public will rightly never accept the huge democratic deficit this implies.
Sideshow over. Now let‚Äôs focus on resolving the real Brexit issues. https://t.co/rgKEKF1D1O
The country is divided. Parliament is in deadlock. That was the case yesterday, and is still the case today - this flows directly from the fact that we have a hung parliament.  Changing leader will not address this real and pressing issue with Brexit - this should be our focus.
The choice between chaos and the gov‚Äôt deal, which leavers and remainers dislike, is now clearly a false one. It‚Äôs in the national interest that the government considers all the options rather than pursuing a deal that will risk the Union and leave us poorer &amp; weaker as a country https://t.co/PP6goNQwZN

Levelling with the public and parliament on Brexit is key to restoring trust in politics, healing divisions and unifying the country behind any preferred outcome, which is why the Attorney General‚Äôs legal advice should be published in full before next weeks historic vote.

Very constructive meeting with leading charities @Bright_Tweets @Causeway_Edu @up_Reach @IntoUniversity @theaccessp &amp; @ImpetusPEF on helping the most disadvantaged young people in our society get to university - Access is a top priority for this Government. https://t.co/aIZIzKby98
The study also shines a light on a clutch of institutions and courses that are failing to deliver for students &amp; the @officestudents has a mandate to focus on quality, including de-registration for those institutions that fail to raise their game.
Earnings are not everything - there are many degrees that are worthwhile that do not have a big return, like careers in the arts or the third sector that have a very high social value, but good to see this study exploring the earnings of graduates.
It‚Äôs especially positive for women as they earn 28% more than if they didn‚Äôt go to uni and for men it‚Äôs 8% - this is expected to rise as you enter middle age.
Today we‚Äôve announced the biggest ever study on financial returns from higher education - the report from  @TheIFS shows the graduate premium, at age 29, is holding up even with the expansion in numbers in HE.
Completely agree. https://t.co/KjBd3RVWZH

@EricRoyalLybeck Making it even more advantageous for companies to offer employees shares through the tax system...has mor upsides than expropriation, which will lead to capital flight..
Popular capitalism is a great idea. But there is a difference b/n incentivising businesses to give shares to staff, &amp; the gov't forcibly taking property (shares) from private companies for itself, with the promise that dividends will go to workers. Polling should make this clear!
Good points. Remarkable given the rise of Asia and the continued strength of the US. Britain as a global beacon of excellence is good news for our national and local economies. https://t.co/q2z4miu758

Legislative options are not off the table, but I also expect universities to be taking steps to tackle this issue - the OfS will take tough action if they fail to do so. 4/4
Students must not resort to cheating - it is not the solution for anyone who may be struggling on their course - the right thing is to speak to lecturers and get the right support. 3/4
University is all about learning, training your intellect and applying knowledge to a high standard. Students work incredibly hard to get a place at university and those who choose to cheat risk throwing it all away, cheating their futures, for the sake of a short-cut. 2/4
Today's news on essay mills reveals the scale of the black market available to students - these services are normalising and enabling cheating, but also trying to devalue the quality of our degrees and put our world-class reputation at risk. 1/4

Arrived @NASA_Johnson to meet officials to discuss how we can work closely with @NASA as we reach for the stars, explore their model for the role of private companies in supporting space exploration, as well as experience some of their flagship robotics research labs first-hand. https://t.co/bilQQk6pFd
Spot on. What's the point of a mayor who cannot put together an effective plan to tackle violent crime. Sadiq Khan is finding blaming the Tories is easy, but governing is much harder. He might as well let @ShaunBaileyUK get on with it. https://t.co/j6CHsj2et5

Off to the US where I‚Äôll be taking in 3 states in four days focusing on innovation and space. I'll be be working to expand UK/US collaboration, particularly on space tech - essential to our ambition to own 10% of the global space market by 2030.
Terrific interview https://t.co/mBsPGofoYt
Mental health and wellbeing is so important and critical to success, which is why I have written to Uni VCs ahead of the new academic year to make this a top priority.  https://t.co/TreeWzVq3Y
If universities are not about the free exchange of ideas then what are they for.  Robust debate of contentious issues - to reach the truth - should be core to university life. Liberal  democracy is under threat so we have to remake the case for it‚Äôs core values - free speech https://t.co/25woaMQl3P
On legal free speech on campus: students should be free &amp; encouraged to hear difficult speakers, debate with them, and make up their own minds. This should be done with civility, with neither side giving or taking offence for the sake of it. #OpenFuture
Very much enjoyed @TheEconomist #OpenFuture discussion on free speech. We need more thoughtful and constructive debates like this https://t.co/OumZSfpzky
Looking forward to speaking @TheEconomist Open Future event tomorrow on legal free speech and why it is a genuine problem on campus, the need for diversity of thought and opinion &amp; why there is no such thing as a right not to be offended.
Thank you for having me https://t.co/VfcWQcP5Ro

Great event @USUKFulbright 70th anniversary where we announced a big funding boost taking UK contribution to ¬£1m to support this exchange programme - it helps students experience world class education in the UK &amp; US, reinforcing the special relationship between our two countries https://t.co/RBKVUQ0nPB
Capitalism is in the dock. Tonight I will be speaking at @CPSThinkTank on Reinvigorating Capitalism and growing the national cake. We should all back open markets against the attacks from the far left. I‚Äôll also have a fair bit to say about the gig economy...
Welcoming the @countybordnews to Twitter - make sure you follow them for all the latest on my WW1 campaign and to stay up-to-date on news from across East Surrey. https://t.co/19EzYya7DU
Will be giving evidence to the @CommonsSTC on Quantum technology with @UKRI_CEO. UK has a world leading position in this emerging and hugely competitive field, and we are determined to stay ahead of the pack.

@martincoward Might be a good idea to read the speech for context.
Well said! https://t.co/Xf3BgREXzH
With the HE sector contributing more to our national output than our car &amp; defence industries &amp; bringing in more than natural gas and Scotch whisky in exports, universities are a vital part of our country's future post-Brexit - a line from my speech today at the UUK conference.

Superb piece by @Fox_Claire on the crisis of free speech in our political discourse. ‚ÄúFree speech is carelessly tossed to one side in order to silence views and people that liberals label as intolerant‚Äù. https://t.co/k1FxIxPJp7
Good luck to all those getting their A-level results today. Nothing quite compares to the nerves you feel waiting to open that envelope - but even if you don‚Äôt get what you hoped for or expected, remember there is always a way forward. #alevelresults2018
Terrific progress - a national gem! https://t.co/JeTIi8TgJA

A real privilege to meet the great minds @iitmadras behind projects that are saving lives &amp; livelihoods - including low-cost water purification, improving vaccinations to reduce infant deaths &amp; helping farmers maximise crop yields. All supported by @NewtonFund @UKinIndia https://t.co/Hnefbx9YhS
A great morning @iitmadras, the leading engineering institute in India, where I had a go on a prototype electric tuk-tuk - it could help reduce air pollution in major cities &amp; is an example of how new and improved battery technology could change lives. @FaradayInst https://t.co/1BxATtdwLO
Really enjoyed speaking at an exciting #edtech event co-hosted by @inBritish @DFID_UK &amp; @p4commission exploring how using more technology in education can empower the next generation of students to help change the world. https://t.co/iblnKHHvgt
Universities are rightly autonomous in their control of admissions and degree-awarding powers, but with this autonomy comes the responsibility to deliver the highest quality for their students. https://t.co/U1gpmFtjaD
@monarchomach I was very clear there is a distinction  between using unconditional offers as a selection tool and using them as a recruitment tool with little regard for quality
Finding the right balance between having a safe &amp; secure approach to drone use in the UK and allowing a market worth ¬£42bn to our economy to flourish is key - so have your say here with this consultation launched by @transportgovuk https://t.co/zkvmseVNf5
Visited the @electropreneur in New Delhi and was really impressed by the work they are doing, particularly this new low-cost 'heart patch' designed to monitor vital signs and general health after patients have left hospital...I had to have a go. https://t.co/grbSn8KLlq
Universities risks undermining their own success and long term reputation by using unconditional offers as a recruitment tool to gets bums on seats - this cannot be in the long term interests of students.
An incredible discovery on Mars by the team from @esa - more research is needed but it raises the tantalising prospect of their being life on Mars and helping answer a fundamental question ‚Äì are we alone in the universe. @esascience #Mars https://t.co/170Qukyw5Y

Where are your manners, Mr President?
Fantastic to see the brightest &amp; the best from around the world queuing to study at our world class universities in a v. competitive market place. Openness to ideas and top talent are key to the success of our universities and our economy. https://t.co/WUX4DjdZKp
We‚Äôre doing this by investing ¬£1bn in low-carbon power units and state-of-the-art batteries, ¬£1.5bn to help people buy low-emission cars &amp; investing in electric charging infrastructure &amp; hydrogen re-fuelling stations. 2/2
With half of young people wanting an electric car, it‚Äôs good news that our #IndustrialStrategy aims to make Britain the global leader in the design &amp; manufacture of zero-emission vehicles, with the aim of all cars &amp; vans being zero-emission by 2040. https://t.co/vo05aHY5VN 1/2

Incredible form here from some Typhoons for #RAF100 #RAF100flypast https://t.co/iRdo5M6DlL
As we celebrate #RAF100, we must always remember this sacrifice and what it meant for our country - and in turn honour those pilots, who over the years, have taken to the skies, the engineers who gave them wings &amp; the support personnel who made it all possible.
78 years ago today the Battle of Britain began ‚Äì 640 planes with 2936 pilots from 15 countries came together to take on the seemingly unstoppable Luftwaffe - four months later at the cost of 1,023 planes and the loss of 544 pilots, the battle was won.
@MattHancock @DCMS Massive congratulations.
@elvismiggell @thisisnessiecom As IP Minister I'll be looking into this with the Intellectual Property Office.
It can‚Äôt be right that the designs and ideas of a small &amp; successful business, like at @thisisnessiecom in my constituency, can be ripped-off so easily on social media platforms. Sites like Facebook have a duty of care to prevent small businesses having their creations stolen.

@RECNeil @Samfr 100% agree. Less hype, no wags, great team...that's how it should be...
@Samfr Different generation of footballers though. No need to accommodate Gerard and Lampard in an unworkable midfield (for example) because they were big names and had to be picked.
Classy comment from the Swedish ambo. https://t.co/V5VFgxsZkX

@DPJHodges And now...
@JonathanSEllis Points well made. But we've had the referendum.
@jackwdoyle @DailyMailUK Nice one. Have you got your waistcoat on?
@SusieD_LON That's a long sentence, but I get your point. It's still a negotiation, however you frame it.
@JonathanSEllis Of course we want a deal that works for both sides. But Barnier is not an impartial referee. He‚Äôs looking out for the interests of the Commission and the EU 27. We must do the same for our country. That‚Äôs the nature of a negotiation.
Love it. https://t.co/5nTr1jiu4B
Result! Cabinet has united around a Brexit deal.The point is not whether it's hard Brexit or soft Brexit, terms which entrench the deep division and passion from the referendum of two years ago.

Breaking. To become the go to country for science and innovation, we need to be a magnet for top talent. And this announcement is a big step forward. Thanks @sajidjavid https://t.co/sXMdB84TcU
@zoebulaitis @PeterFifield Very clever...
Just to be clear...the NHS is a shared national endeavour born from cross-party thinking with Conservative MP, Henry Willink, writing a White Paper on a 'National Health Service' in 1944...and the @Conservatives have been looking after the NHS for 43 of its 70 years. https://t.co/fqVixIv8eo
From mass vaccination &amp; IVF to keyhole surgery &amp; genomics, the NHS has long been a pioneer of new treatments over its 70 years - we can expect more as the great minds in the NHS, universities &amp; labs across the country work on the next generation of medical treatments #NHS70
Today we are celebrating the 70th anniversary of the NHS. It‚Äôs greatness rests on the labours of generations of doctors, nurses &amp; staff. It is also the result of seven decades of breakthrough science ‚Äì from CT scanning to IVF. Here‚Äôs to another 70 years. #NHS70

@Sathnam Of course. And by the way, its not my core argument. It's simply a comment on how the debate is conducted. And by the way, I spent years helping my college raise bursary funds for disadvantaged students. I was onto this issue before I got this job!
Helpful analysis from @Channel4News. To have any hope of solving the serious issues around Access to our elite universties, we need to delve deeply into what is going on in schools, at the application/offer stage, and post acceptance. @jgro_the https://t.co/HAZaevulAM
@jgro_the @toadmeister @DavidLammy @jgro_the you like to stir! Not blaming David Lammy who is a good friend. Point is some black pupils are deterred from applying to Oxford because they think it's not for them. Implying Oxford doesn't want people like them is hardly a way to encourage applications.
@jgro_the Nothing extraordinary. We need real diversity of thought on campus, and to be mindful that in some cases a monoculture means students &amp; lecturers with legitimate but maybe unpopular views self-censor for fear of opprobrium. This is what I'm hearing on campus.

Tough night in Tandridge, on the back of local planning &amp; housing issues. We‚Äôve lost some of our most hardworking and committed councillors. Commiserations, and thanks to you all, for your years of public service for the community.
Superb points on student finance system by @MartinSLewis. https://t.co/bFAEXmlxYE
@wesstreeting Two points here: 1) Legal free speech is core to the free exchange of ideas &amp; the university experience.  2) We're acting on the recommendations from the enquiry by the @HumanRightsCtte led by @HarrietHarman
Great session with peers on university policy at the first meeting of our Higher Education Interest Group. Lots of valuable expertise across the Lords  to tap into. https://t.co/y2yoSjARIW
This has nothing to do with promoting something that's low quality, it's promoting something that is simply wrong - these websites may be legal, but it's a case of doing what's right &amp; endorsing cheating surely isn't the message you'd want to send to your million+ followers? https://t.co/WKXScG8kt5
What happened to the Windrush Generation is an indefensible INJUSTICE &amp; it would be no matter the colour or race of the victims - therefore I'm extremely disappointed that Afua Hirsch is using this to compare black Conservative MPs to disgraced Bill Cosby. https://t.co/kA31Tgl43y
Fantastic bit of investigative journalism by @bbceducation on essay farms. One of the vloggers marketing Edubirdie's services has contacted me to apologise - they should ALL cut their ties with Edubirdie &amp; actively promote the value of education &amp; learning.
@DylanStrain @KwasiKwarteng @AdamAfriyie Erm...check my Twitter feed properly.
It's right that people pay their fair share of tax and the #SanctionsBill will help do just that - it will help tackle the flow of dirty money and shine a light on the shady practices used globally to launder money.
Interesting point by my colleague @JustineGreening ‚Äì I think it‚Äôs always worth reminding ourselves that the main point of diversity in the workplace is to draw talent from the widest possible pool, not to pit one group against the other https://t.co/PefX4Lqmn8

Beer brewed by artificial intelligence? Yep, that‚Äôs what I saw first-hand today @IntelligentX_ai ‚Äì an example of how AI could transform every aspect of our lives &amp; why the Gov‚Äôt is investing ¬£1bn as part of the #AISectorDeal to place the UK at the forefront of this revolution. https://t.co/jCgZdQI6Rt

Simply put, the Windrush Generation are British, they always were, and they should not have been treated any other way. This should never have happened, but pleased to see the Gov't taking comprehensive action to right these wrongs.

Following the report from the @UniversitiesUK sexual violence &amp; harassment taskforce, we have asked the HE sector to do more, implement their recommendations &amp; move forward to make a real difference to students across the country.
Violence &amp; sexual harassment in any setting is completely unacceptable &amp; victims should feel able to report cases to the police - the Govt expects universities to take a zero-tolerance approach to this so students feel confident &amp; able to report what they have experienced.
As I said in Nov last year and again in Jan, we need a plan to deal with the tragic loss of life we've seen - blaming cuts is not a plan @SadiqKhan, we all want to find a solution and Conservative Assembly Members like @ShaunBaileyUK want to work with you - so what's the plan? https://t.co/P9zel6TiTj

@wethemultitude @CanterburyCCUni Hi Emma, it is indeed still going ahead and if anything changes we'll let you know.
I will be speaking at the launch of the Office for Students today - the biggest shake-up in the regulation of Higher Education in 30 years and one that puts students at its heart.
@dweinkove You can still suspend action now to minimise disruption, now that talks are underway with a credible conciliator involved.
@dweinkove I am concerned for the students, who by the way,  ultimately pay the salaries of striking staff numbers.
Encouraged @ucu and @UniversitiesUK #uss pension talks are progressing, with conciliation service @acasorguk now involved. Students should not lose a day more of the education they are paying, for than is absolutely necessary, so strike should now be suspended.
Looking forward to speaking to students &amp; staff @CanterburyCCUni this Thursday about higher education and wider political issues. #SamOnCampus https://t.co/6unUq1qTqE
Well said. https://t.co/XyV1JavGI4
Students are rightly concerned about compensation during @ucu strikes. I expect all universities affected to make clear that any money not paid to lecturers - as a consequence of strike action - will go towards student benefit including compensation
Welcome the news that @UniversitiesUK will hold talks with @ucu starting next week - in the interest of students, time for the UCU to suspend strike action and give these latest talks a chance.

Universities should consider the impact of any industrial action on their students, who deserve to receive the service that they are paying for. (2/4)

@markmleach @Conservatives Record numbers of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Part time numbers v important - review will look at
@TDHaynes1998 That‚Äôs not policy.  That‚Äôs ill informed speculation.
@adam_matthews On the contrary. They shouldn‚Äôt be.
@baileys72 Yes. The ¬£10k is the top up the the govt pays in addition to the fees
On Labour: If Uni is free, then numbers will be capped &amp; it will be exclusive. Quality will take a hit. @Conservatives want a world class system open to the most disadvantaged in our society /10
Review is needed because these are hard issues with tough trade offs &amp; we don‚Äôt want to undermine achievements of the system as it stands /9
Reason for review c) Ensure current finance system is delivering for everyone / 8
We are not about capping the numbers that go to uni. No limit on aspiration for academic route or the skills / technical education route /8
Reason for review b) We need a better joined up system between HE and FE, and a system that delivers for the 50% who don‚Äôt go to uni /7
Reason for review a): More choice, different ways of studying, different price points would help improve value for money for students /6
High cost subjects like science and engineering also subsidised by ¬£2k per student per year.  medicine is ¬£10k per student per year /5
Current system is fair.  Those who benefit share cost of education with taxpayer. Taxpayer contributes 45%.  /4
Current system, under @Conservatives has delivered more places with record numbers of disadvantaged students going to uni /3
Our world class uni system rests on having a sustainable system of funding for our unis / 2
THREAD on Review: In Higher Education, we are a global superpower with 4 of our unis in top 10, 16 in top 100, second only to the US  /1
@DavidDye9 @skynewsniall @JPonpolitics You don‚Äôt have to tune in -:)
I‚Äôll be on @skynewsniall and @JPonpolitics later this morning to discuss student finance and our impending Review of the post 18 education landscape, and how it can deliver the best outcomes for young people, whichever path they choose.
Up next on #samoncampus, I'll be visiting @ManMetUni and speaking to students &amp; staff in @TheUnionMMU on Friday 23rd Feb - you can sign up here: https://t.co/bstHWbu4mR https://t.co/fHOXsBzvRp
Great news on the front page of the @MetroUK this morning - first-time buyers at an 11-year high shows our housing policy is helping more people feel that joy of owning your own home. https://t.co/5Yv8n5CKLq
@Jeremy_the_Grey @unibirmingham In the interests of balance https://t.co/Bm3OseenmB
@RichardTol Well, you seem to be suggesting all students think the same. Not the case in my experience.
@AndrewAbraham11 @unibirmingham Really. Check out the Queen Mary video from a couple of weeks ago.  We aim to present the events as accurately as we can, not least because many who attend are on Twitter anyway and will know if we don't. Also not everyone wants to be recorded.
Spot on. #LostEinsteins https://t.co/4mYLEzFXNO
At my visit to @unibirmingham, I asked students to tell me the one thing they would do if they had my job for a day and here are a few of their thoughts. #samoncampus https://t.co/NSzIJ3sLru
@JarradJohnson Thanks v. helpful
So on International #WomenInScienceDay, we need to make sure we don‚Äôt lose their contribution to scientific discovery &amp; innovation on which progress and our future depends. So these #LostEinsteins, as @Stanford calls them, need our support #wecandobetter
17% of full time STEM professors are female compared to 26.7% in non STEM subjects #LostEinsteins ...5/6
If all women who wanted to work in STEM and wider industries were employed, GDP growth would be up to 10% higher by 2030 #LostEinsteins ...4/6.
Just 1 in 8 jobs requiring advanced STEM skills go to women #LostEinsteins ...3/6
Only 51% of female STEM graduates go onto work in STEM roles, compared to 68% of men #LostEinsteins ...2/6
At a talk @QMUL a post-grad science student raised the issue of women in science - so I decided to look into it and here are some startling stats...1/6
A couple of thoughts from my piece in @thesundaytimes today on free speech and its importance for a thriving political culture at our universities and nationally‚Ä¶ https://t.co/mGeWunO1g0
@jim_dickinson That's my intention.
Some fair points on the fact that the headline to my comment piece refers to Further Education. The publication - not the author - decides the headline to any piece.
@trumpy675 I didn‚Äôt decide the headline. The paper did
@jim_dickinson Thanks @jim_dickinson. I think the piece is pretty balanced.
My pieces for the Sunday Times Red Box is also in my Facebook page: Further Education should be demanding and disorientating - not an echo chamber https://t.co/MnMzqObHbW
#ICYMI another great example of  a brilliant British breakthrough - this research @EdinburghUni could help transform lives by preserving the fertility of children having cancer treatment. https://t.co/8LaMGnfdhx

66 years ago today, Princess Elizabeth formally became our Queen and Head of the Commonwealth...at just 25 years old. Wishing Her Majesty a restful day as she celebrates with her family. #bestofbritish

We have to make sure the creeping culture of censorship doesn‚Äôt take root in our universities and stop the widening of horizons that is so crucial to university life ‚Äì some of my thoughts from my hearing today with the @HumanRightsCtte . https://t.co/wDWfyHfpio
@BhamPolicy #hellobrum
Looking forward to visiting @unibirmingham this Friday - will be speaking directly to students &amp; staff about politics, what matters to them and what my priorities should be. #SamOnCampus
I will be speaking to the @HumanRightsCtte at 3.15pm this afternoon about freedom of speech, no-platforming, safe-spaces and Prevent.
Congratulations to @SpaceX and @elonmusk and the successful test of their Heavy Falcon rocket - it could usher in a new era of space travel that the UK could be primed to exploit too.
The Suffragette flag flying @beisgovuk in honour of #100years since women (over 30, with property) were allowed to vote - a great moment in history - but we cannot wait 100 more years for equality in every aspect of society, from politics to the boardroom to the payslip.#Vote100 https://t.co/GznM5bN02p
Back in October I shared my thoughts on why @Conservatives should go to universities to engage in the battle of ideas. We cannot leave the field open to Corbyn: the stakes are too high.  https://t.co/IiE4T0nHqZ https://t.co/MVaOVWQPSw
As of today, the #BerlinWall has been down as long as it was up, 10,316 days. People were willing to tear down the wall with their bare hands to enjoy political and economic freedom. Freedoms we can so easily take for granted. #freespeech #freemarkets https://t.co/SSib9PaUnU
Shared my thoughts on free speech, growing up in Ghana and my time as David Cameron‚Äôs eyes and ears with @bbcnickrobinson on this weeks latest Political Thinking podcast. https://t.co/nN0zLYFuTI
Extremely disappointed that a genuine opportunity to engage in debate was nearly thwarted by thuggish behaviour. Free speech under the law is fundamental to our democracy. Well done @Jacob_Rees_Mogg for not be cowed into silence.
Great to meet EU Science Commissioner @Moedas. Looking forward to continuing to strengthen the ties we have on science and innovation. #IndustrialStrategy #COMPET https://t.co/LwQwb7pSRC
@GuidoFawkes In Bulgaria championing British Science post Brexit. Committed to doing a good job, in a great brief. Not I Sir!
Collaboration is key to our future - which is why I am in Bulgaria meeting with my EU counterparts to show we want a deep and special relationship in science, research and innovation to help tackle the global challenges we all face. https://t.co/gNQmXgjGf0
We must have this conversation - speak up and speak out about mental health problems so we can help those in need. This is a growing issue, particularly among students, and I look forward to having an open and frank discussion as I visit universities across the country. https://t.co/twVerbeWoq
New report from @ukhesa shows 90% of those that go to university come from state school - good progress on widening participation in higher education, but still more to do on fair access. https://t.co/MSoR1eW6LM
These projects draw together our expertise to help tackle some of the biggest health challenges faced by developing countries including malaria and poor antenatal care ‚Äì they will help improve the quality of life for some of the world's poorest people. https://t.co/wpSkkTZuJI

The @jodrellbank Observatory is such a great nomination of a #UNESCO World Heritage Site ‚Äì the first of its kind in the world and its pioneering work has helped further our understanding of the universe ‚Äì it also looks really cool. @OfficialUoM
Interesting thoughts on Higher Education from @NickBoles @NSoames &amp; @halfon4harlowMP in The Sun today, great on opportunity of alternatives to university - I discussed this in the Chamber today - this Gov't will put no limit on aspiration, whatever that may be. https://t.co/CK580hcA5v
Hysterical that the Socialist Workers' Student Society are trying to stop @Jacob_Rees_Mogg speaking @QMUL - last time I checked he's not part of a banned organisation, he's a Tory MP and is pure box office.
I'm pleased to announce a ¬£14m boost for 5 research projects led by @UniofOxford @LancasterUni @UofGlasgow &amp; @LivUni to help us better understand #BigData - if we can truly understand its potential, it can change the way we live our lives. #IndustrialStrategy @beisgovuk @EPSRC https://t.co/JhjvW9Pp6H
Repayment threshold raised from ¬£21 k to ¬£25k. Fees frozen last academic year. New regulator (OFS) to champion value for money for students coming into effect. This is real action. My comments on @BBCr4today relate to the wider review of post 18 education - needs careful thought https://t.co/azvQDgq9S8
‚ÄúMemories are not the key to the past, but to the future‚Äù words from Corrie Ten Boom, a hero who helped hide Jews from certain death. As she says, we must use our shared memories of this truly awful period in human history to ensure it never happens again. #HolocaustMemorialDay
#ICYMI - A fantastic example of expertise from British universities being exported to help a truly worthy cause. @sheffhallamuni have been working with police forces in India to improve access to justice for female victims of violence. #JusticeForHer https://t.co/IxDEvER45y
Great to see our GDP growing faster than expected ‚Äì thank you to the businesses and companies that have helped our economy grow and looking forward to the role our cutting-edge science, research &amp; innovation will play in the years to come.
This will allow universities, employers &amp; industry leaders to work together to get graduates learning the right skills, from cyber security to artificial intelligence to industrial design. https://t.co/9vRqfYbNnG
After my talk @MileEndInst, here's a snapshot of what students, academics and those in HE think my priorities should be - we may not always agree, but I always promise to listen. #SamOnCampus https://t.co/NXVgzj65CV
Very much looking forward to working with the sector on the challenges and opportunities ahead. https://t.co/uxL2zGNxjW
Couldn‚Äôt agree more https://t.co/haUHBC3yle

Great to see Gary Oldman nominated for his role as Winston Churchill at the #Oscars ‚Äì a fitting portrayal of one of our finest PMs and greatest of Britons, who passed away on this day in 1965. He roared for our freedom in our darkest hour #BestOfBritish .

A pleasure to speak at the @royalsociety last night about science and innovation - while there, I came across this mace given to the Society by King Charles II when it was founded in 1660. https://t.co/8h8PpE2u9Z
Looking forward to my first speech on science at the @royalsociety this afternoon with the title "If you want a future, it helps to have a map".
Not surprised at all by this - social media companies also need to do more to tackle mental health issues. Like oil companies have to clean up oil spills, social media firms must deal with the psychological and emotional impacts of using their platforms. https://t.co/q1CZwN4yiw

@GavinBarwell @JBrokenshire Wishing you a speedy recovery.
One of my favourite lines from an inaugural speech: ‚Äúwith malice toward none, with charity for all...let us strive to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation‚Äôs wounds‚Äù. Abraham Lincoln, 1865.
Well said. And successive governments have increased health spending, a fact the left simply ignores for political purposes. Truth is complex issues NHS faces go beyond party politics. https://t.co/BmZctfWMrZ
A fantastic and engaging event last night @MileEndInst with our great host @philipjcowley discussing my new role, the HE sector and speaking directly to students about what matters to them. (photo credit: @garyschwartz) https://t.co/rSoXupFK94
A great piece from @PaulGoodmanCH for @ConHome, we need to get out there and take Westminster to universities and engage directly with the next generation with humility. https://t.co/RF15jIe7X1

@jon_scott Any suggestions?
Looking forward to continuing my tour of universities at @QMUL, an @RussellGroup uni which takes highest proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Going to speak directly to the students about issues that matter to them &amp; the challenges we all face going forward.
RIP #DoloresORiordan. Soundtrack to a generation.
‚ÄúThe function of education is to teach one to think intensively and critically. Intelligence plus character - that is the goal of true education.‚Äù One of my favourite quotes from Martin Luther King Jr and very apt in my new role. Wishing everyone in the US a restful #MLKDay

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel safe walking the streets of London after my friend got stabbed‚Äù ‚Äì this is what a 16-year-old told me at a youth club in London. Now we have 4 more tragic deaths on NYE‚Ä¶you called knife crime an epidemic @SadiqKhan, but what is the plan?

The response of @SadiqKhan to the "epidemic" of knife crime in London is an advert backed by celebrity influencers. Really? I truly hope this works as lives of young people across the capital depend on it. #LondonNeedsAction #ThursdayThoughts

There are patriots who voted leave and patriots who voted remain. We should stop describing each other as mutineers, enemies &amp; saboteurs. Ultimately, all of us, young and old, leavers and remainers, have to work together to build our post-Brexit future. https://t.co/hTl6xcdQjX

@soniasodha Culture has to &amp; can change. It starts with men and women having the confidence to speak out, knowing they will be believed and action taken.
Wishing Alex Salmond well with his new chat show, just hope he doesn't borrow any tips from RT for running The Scotsman
The fall of the #BerlinWall ushered in an era of hope and progress with capitalism as its heart. Now, we must once again resist socialism and keep the torch of freedom and opportunity burning bright with a vision young people across the country can believe in. #ThursdayThoughts
Fall of #berlinwall shows the power of ordinary people to bring about extraordinary change &amp; what the human spirit can achieve with belief

@RichardBurgon Do you condemn the strike which is causing misery to hundreds of thousands of passengers. Key question is: whose side are you on?

@Dee0871 No need for surprise.  My question is a fair and straightforward one.
@DannyShawBBC @MayorofLondon @SadiqKhan So far @MayorofLondon has pointed the finger at everyone else including asking schools to do more. Question is what is he doing
@DannyShawBBC @MayorofLondon @SadiqKhan The Mayor is responsible 4 crime and policing in London, so I‚Äôm wondering what the plan is, given he has said, knife crime is an ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù
Another teenager a victim of knife crime last night, an epidemic says @MayorofLondon. How many more deaths before you act @SadiqKhan?
