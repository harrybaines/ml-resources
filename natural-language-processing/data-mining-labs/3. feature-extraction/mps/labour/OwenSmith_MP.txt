Another massive defeat for the Government tonight. They have no mandate for this reckless Brexit Deal - and no means of securing a majority for it. Parliament must now ask the people to accept or reject this Brexit catastrophe.

You don‚Äôt need to be eavesdropping on Olly Robbins in a Brussels bar to know Mrs May‚Äôs threat of no-deal is as empty as a Brexiteer‚Äôs promise. But there is a way she can get her Deal without resorting to blackmail - by accepting the Kyle-Wilson Compromise: https://t.co/A9WDk8PMd1

Anyone who believes Theresa May is doing anything other than running down the clock is completely naive. The plan is totally transparent: bounce MPs into agreeing her Deal at the very last minute. It‚Äôs bullying and blackmail to save her skin and her party.

Good to hear @Keir_Starmer underlining @UKLabour support for the #NorthernIreland backstop- vital to preserve an open border and the GFA. But the best way to do that remains to ask people to vote again and guarantee peace through saving the UK from Brexit.
So the PM is now outsourcing Brexit (&amp; the Good Friday Agreement) to a rag-tag team of the sacked, resigned &amp; desperate-to-be-back. If ever there were a sign Westminster has failed &amp; the people need to take control of Brexit with another vote, this is it! https://t.co/P1sEF1wyB7

That‚Äôs it then. The fix is in. The DUP and ERG are rowing in behind the PM to deliver her hard Brexit, leaving the UK outside the Single Market and Customs Union. Poorer, isolated and turning our back on Labour‚Äôs values of tolerance at home and international solidarity abroad.

@MadameGPWales @BMACymru I‚Äôll set up a meeting to discuss.
@JamesMunro5 Not at all. I just know the system experienced by many of my constituents doesn‚Äôt work very well for them.
@5Roads @MadameGPWales Not really. It was written with ironic intent. Although I should have learned by now that irony and twitter don‚Äôt mix.
2/2 Not all surgeries employ this ‚Äòtelephone at 0830 and try your luck-style‚Äô of appointments system - but lots do in my patch. And though it may manage demand effectively for the GPs, it is both frustrating and ineffective for patients.
To all Drs on my timeline in light of my pointing out how hard it is to get a GP appointment, I agree (a) 9 years of cuts are part of the problem (Labour grew NHS spending from ¬£39Bn to ¬£113Bn with big gains for GPs) (b) There aren‚Äôt enough GPs (c) Demand is spiralling. But...1/2
@MadameGPWales @amcunningham I rang my GP more than 300 times over five weeks, on a Monday and a Friday, before I got an appointment. My constituents recounts similar experiences with regularity.
@MadameGPWales I don‚Äôt dispute that all of those issues are part of this problem, but it doesn‚Äôt alter the fact that there is now a post-code lottery as to whether your GP has adopted one of these systems, or allows people to turn up and queue as used to be the case, or has online booking.
@OurChildren1RCT @HawthornHighSch @HawthornPrimary The questionnaire tells parents to respond to the consultation. That‚Äôs what people need to do first and foremost. My questionnaire is additional.
@cathode_blue @WelshLabour I am
We have to get our GPs to change the systems they use to allocate appointments. It‚Äôs almost impossible to get an appointment with mine (they‚Äôd all sold out by 0835 today) and I know that‚Äôs a situation experienced by millions in Britain. No wonder A&amp;E fills up.

Other than her tone being slightly more subdued, there is no tangible change being offered by the PM. It‚Äôs as though last week‚Äôs gargantuan defeat never happened. And hard to conclude that her aim is to do anything other than run down the clock.

@GoodwayCardiff @Iambrittlebones @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour Yes, they can be &amp; will be if we Brexit. As much as 10% worse off, according to T May. That will be felt most in places with the least, as usual. Many people voted Brexit cos rightly felt left behind. Brexit will push them down not help them up. Appeasement won‚Äôt change that.
@GoodwayCardiff @Iambrittlebones @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour I do Russell, I think we should respect them by telling the truth: that Brexit will make them poorer; that it will deepen the inequality they see between Ely and Ealing (for example); and that it will diminish Labour‚Äôs ability to invest in Wales or in public services anywhere.
@GoodwayCardiff @Iambrittlebones @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour My constituents in Pontypridd voted to Remain, Russell. https://t.co/sNrP1L99lX
Defeat for the PMs Brexit by 230 votes. A truly historic defeat &amp; one that should lead the PM to resign. @jeremycorbyn is right to move no confidence in the Govt, but if that vote is lost  @UKLabour should swiftly support a #peoplesvote and a chance to save Britain from Brexit.
@MikeRose50 With respect, that‚Äôs not true, Mike. RCT voted Leave as a whole, Ponty voted to Remain. And polling - and my covversations with friends, neighbours and constituents - show that Remain opinion is  only growing. https://t.co/uz32okGVhC
Brexit is a lie. It will leave the UK poorer, weaker &amp; isolated. It benefits only politicians &amp; bosses who believe Thatcherite deregulation, lower wages, fewer workers rights &amp; more austerity are the route to economic &amp; political success. I will vote against it today with pride.

Tory Brexiteer objections to the Grieve amendment are utterly revealing of their Brexit Strategy: spin this out to the last second and force the Commons to accept Brexit at No Deal gun point.

@EvanstheAirwave Wotcha! I thought he understated the point made by the BoE about fx of trade &amp; border disruption on GDP. It‚Äôs not just trade in completed goods, it‚Äôs the movement of parts in our integrated supply lines. Also says we can always ‚Äòlower standards‚Äô to rebound. That‚Äôs horribly true!
@MrTardigradeUK The Government‚Äôs own economic impact assessment, published just last month. It says No Deal will cut 6-9.3% off GDP - ie almost 10% of our economy. So that‚Äôs the official view of Steve Barclay, Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and other Brexiteers.
Just done  another BBC interview when they reply to my note that the Govt says No Deal will cut 6-9% off GDP with their now standard ‚Äòah, but not all economists agree with that.‚Äô No, just 99% of them! It‚Äôs like when they‚Äôd give ‚Äòeditorial balance‚Äô to warnings of climate change!
@KillianMike Turns out I was right though, Mike. The Tories have ignored it. It‚Äôs only effective if a no confidence motion in Government, and under terms of the Fixed Term Parliament Act. They can‚Äôt ignore that. Hopefully we will now move on to that.
Brilliant stuff from @annaturley https://t.co/ZrMTd2dbCe
@andyhowellsport The public may well be fed up - but it‚Äôs as nothing to how fed up they will be when they realise we‚Äôve got another 2-4 years of these negotiations ahead of us - whichever way the vote goes. This is just the beginning. Brexit uncertainty may last even longer than Regional Rugby üòâ
Croeso! https://t.co/5LVQl9mnOQ
Delighted to add my name to this motion of no confidence in PM - but still concerned that Govt may simply ignore it. If they do, I am sure we will press on with a motion of no confidence in the GOVT, as provided for under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act. They can‚Äôt ignore that! https://t.co/36pG2j9DIM
@andyhowellsport 82% of the UK‚Äôs 1.75m car exports pa are to the E.U. The 27 EU member states produce 20m cars, exporting 2.3m (11%) of these to the UK. So we risk 80% to their 10%. That‚Äôs why JLR CEO has said Brexit could cost 10s of 1000s of jobs.
The Govt is threatening the Commons &amp; the Country with No Deal - though they acknowledge it might cut GDP by &gt;10%, costing countless jobs in the car, aerospace and chemical industries. I have no confidence that they won‚Äôt let this happen. And so no confidence in this Government.
Can't see that there's much point in a vote of no confidence in the PM - and not the Government (are we saying we have got faith in Grayling, Hunt and the rest of them?). Government will simply ignore it - they can't ignore a motion of no confidence in the Government.

@KyleCla83621681 @RCTCouncil Not a lie at all. Mr Churchill was offered a bed for the weekend in Scott‚Äôs motel - which I thought he had accepted. If he‚Äôs still sleeping rough it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs refused it. I will make more enquiries tomorrow.

@Opensout @TheGreatRemain @Emz5048 @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn @SkyNews The Government‚Äôs own analysis said so last week. As did that by The Bank of England, the National Institute for Economists and Social Research, the IFS, the OBR and my mate Dave down the pub.
@KevinPascoe @Emz5048 @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn @SkyNews A General Election would be great Kevin. And no doubt we will all ‚Äòpush‚Äô for one by voting no confidence in the Government when the Brexit vote is lost next week. But I assume you realise we cant necessarily secure an election? Just as we cant necessarily secure a People‚Äôs Vote.
@Emz5048 @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn @SkyNews I think people would vote to remain if asked again, now they have seen the unattractive reality of Brexit - and that process would help heal divisions. And the one thing most likely to fuel the far right is another decade of austerity - that will inevitably stem from any Brexit.
@Emz5048 @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn @SkyNews It‚Äôs not undermining Jeremy to state that there is no such thing as a ‚Äòjobs first Brexit‚Äô. It‚Äôs just the truth. We need a Labour Government that can repair public services, Brexit will shrink our economy and make that less possible.
@FrancesOGrady And you are right in every respect, Frances. Which is why this MP won‚Äôt be voting for it.

@photographyrsp Well, we exercised it yesterday, I suppose, by charging them with contempt and forcing them to publish the advice today. Parliamentary sovereignty in action, even as we are members of the EU! who'd have thunk it?
Ministers clearly implied that the Brexit Legal Advice couldn‚Äôt be published because it would risk national security or the wider national interest. It‚Äôs publication reveals that was utterly misleading. It simply shows what a poor deal it is. And that the UK could be broken by it
Why can't the Welsh Secretary admit- as the Prime Minister, Chancellor and Financial Secretary have- that their Brexit Deal will make Wales poorer? https://t.co/cD2LC0mz6S
Yes. Because Parliament (on behalf of the people and the nation) has always had sovereign control - irrespective of our E.U. membership. To suggest otherwise was one of the great lies of the Brexit campaign. https://t.co/9qxW4GVf8r
The Prime Minister says the risk we face ‚Äòis that Brexit can be stopped‚Äô. That‚Äôs not a risk, Mrs May, it‚Äôs a golden opportunity to save our country from a future of economic weakness and political isolation. #stopbrexit
Judging from the glum faces of the Tories behind her I think the PM should just say she‚Äôll get her coat...
Last week the PM was still saying this was the only deal possible - now implying (twice) that she might be able to make some changes on the NI backstop?
The Tories have had to pack their front branch with junior ministers to mask the glaring absence of Cabinet support for the Prime Minister.
Parliament taking back control tonight. Nigel Farage should be happy, eh?
Interesting evidence at the Fisheries Bill - the bloke in charge of the MMO (which polices fishing at sea) says the Tories have cut their funding by 60%, while a No Deal Brexit will require the same Tories to double their budget. Good luck with that!

@translunarmusic No. ¬£150 per year after 15 years - ie the loss gets bigger every year. Enjoy!
@KulganofCrydee No. Per annum by end of 15 year period. Keep up!
Philip Hammond‚Äôs admission that Brexit is going to cost our country between ¬£40 and ¬£150 BILLION per year is surely the first time in our history, other than in war, when a British Chancellor has advocated a policy that will inevitably mean cuts to the NHS, Schools, Defence etc?
The Chancellor says ‚ÄòThe economy will be smaller under the Prime Minister‚Äôs preferred option.‚Äô By which he means 1-2% - Or BILLIONS and BILLIONS of pounds less to spend on the NHS, Defence, Education...EVERY YEAR!?
The Chancellor of the Exchequer is currently broadcasting to the nation that every form of Brexit will make us poorer - with Mrs May‚Äôs version cutting 1-2% from our GDP - but that we should go ahead with it anyway. I don‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry.
@DianaJohnsonMP Well done Diana. You were campaigning brilliantly on this issue when I entered Parliament 8 years ago - and you are still fighting for justice for those affected. Great work!
@scoobiesnack0 I‚Äôd be happy with either her Deal versus Remain or No Deal versus Remain.

@IanDunt Not all of us, Ian!
@MartinEdition According to the Government‚Äôs own analysis, this deal will cost is 5% of our GDP over the next 15 years. The same analysis says no deal will cost is 9%.
A loss of ¬£100bn' is the equivalent of losing the output of the City of London, or what we spend per year on the NHS! Now, you could take the view of the Chancellor &amp; say ‚ÄòBrexit isn‚Äôt about the money‚Äô, or you could protect our NHS &amp; demand a #PeoplesVote https://t.co/MoMYh30CEQ

@ChipsEgg @Anglo_Nubian No. That‚Äôs a plate of Gammon. Ponty voted to Remain - 53-47% - and polls now show more than 60% would vote Remain now if  given the chance #PeoplesVote

Clarity at last! The Brexit Plan:   1. Guarantees a fall in UK GDP. 2. Ends our influence over the EU rules we‚Äôll still be bound by. 3. Reduces our freedom to travel and work abroad. 4. Means years more wrangling about the details. Shall we just call it off now?
The Political Declaration confirms that very little is yet agreed (after 2.5 years!) but we we will have increased friction (ie costs and delays) for trade and reduced freedom for our citizens to travel abroad. Why on Earth would anyone vote for this - other than to save Mrs May?
@gabrielleE18 Gabrielle, I first called for People's Vote 2 and a half years ago.
We should stop saying this. It isn‚Äôt true. There is no ‚Äòjobs first‚Äô Brexit to be had. Brexit, in all its forms, will cost us jobs, growth and opportunities.

Penny Mordaunt has left the chamber, Gove never even made it in. The Tory backbenches are silent and the PM looks utterly beleaguered. This may well be her valedictory appearance.
Almost an hour into the PMs statement before a lone Tory MP expresses support for this Brexit bilge. Her plan is a complete non-starter, the House is hopelessly divided and the only way the PM can exit this cul-de-sac is through a vote of the people.
It‚Äôs clear that nobody thinks the Prime Minister‚Äôs deal is a good deal. She must go back to the people #PeoplesVote https://t.co/dd9sasmZgP

PMQs doesn‚Äôt often add to the sum of human knowledge, but today‚Äôs Prime Ministerial discomfort - and the deafening silence on the Tory backbenches - told us all we need to know: Brexit is being botched, Parliament is paralysed and the only sensible option is a #PeoplesVote
Did anyone out there vote for a Brexit plan that would help break up the UK, cede political and economic sovereignty and make us all poorer? No, and I won‚Äôt be voting for it either.
Forget the media hype. It‚Äôs not enough for the PM to secure support for the deal from her Cabinet, or even from Parliament - the people need to be asked to approve, or reject the final #Brexit deal.
3600 people died in The Troubles. After Belfast, Border areas saw the most deaths.

@CllrMWebber Yay! Well done Niall!
@SaraCo130813 @SHINEUKCharity @NigelDoddsDUP @JeffRookerj Almost all the flour we eat in the UK is milled here, though the wheat comes from all over. And most countries only fortify standard white flours, so, yes, there will definitely still be unfortified flour. That said, most flour is already fortified with iron, niacin and thiamin.
@JeffRookerj All credit to you, Jeff, for your leadership on this issue.
Proud to lead today's debate on fortification of flour with folic acid to prevent Spina Bifida + other NTDs and delighted that the Government has listened to our APPG on Folic Acid, to @SHINEUKCharity @NigelDoddsDUP @JeffRookerj Can't think of a better way to mark #ShineBright18
Great job @stellacreasy and @ConorMcGinn ! https://t.co/pO4y4pFNgi
Surely ‚Äòpatriots‚Äô like Farage and his UKIP mates will donate their ¬£160k payoff to the post Brexit NHS? I know it‚Äôs not ¬£350m a week, but every little helps, eh? https://t.co/Rbkkw4SFnr
Victims of the Troubles who need a pension &amp; Victims of Historical Institutional Abuse who need compensation and support will be rightly disappointed and angry tonight that they‚Äôve heard more warm words, but seen no action from their Government in Westminster #NorthernIrelandBill
Deeply depressing, but sadly unsurprising, that Welsh Secretary @AlunCairns was unable to offer any reassurance Wales won‚Äôt be shortchanged by the Tories (as usual) when Brexit ends our support from the EU. #WalesQuestions

Nothing could be further from the truth: In three years of campaigning, meeting 100s of women damaged by #mesh, not ONE has raised the issue of compensation.

The conclusion of this excellent examination of the surgical mesh scandal is spot on: we need a registry for any and all new surgical devices, to track their success or failure. I would add that this should be a condition of licence, and paid for by the manufacturers. https://t.co/oZfQpMxqzJ
.@UKLabour told Osborne, Duncan Smith, McVey and the rest of the rotten bunch that #UniversalCredit was making poor people poorer in 2015. And told them how to fix it. If they now change it - all those who have been shortchanged for the last 3 years should be compensated. https://t.co/FHj14EUR6F

So galling to hear Brexiteers MPs like Mark Francois blithely talk up the prospect of a Canada-style Brexit when car workers living  in my constituency are hearing their bosses at Ford tell them their jobs are at risk if that‚Äôs the outcome.

@WeeWifie1981 Hi. There are so many stories such as yours. And you are not ‚Äòto blame‚Äô in any way, of course. Fortifying flour wouldn‚Äôt eradicate NTDs, but the evidence shows it would prevent 70%+. And with no risks for the wider population as our bodies excrete any excess folic acid.
This is one of the people controlling the destinies of Great Britain and Ireland at present. Heaven help us. https://t.co/sq2DwQ9gAl
Some of the facts about the benefits of fortification of flour with folic acid: https://t.co/nLrnMRb009
@Sammyo2179 @NigelDoddsDUP @JeffRookerj @ShineKateSteele @SteveBrineMP No, Neural Tube Defects occur in first trimester, before many women know they are pregnant, so supplementation doesn‚Äôt work. That‚Äôs why USA, Australia, Canada and 80 other countries do this. 2 foetuses are aborted every day, 2 kids with NTDs born each week in UK. 70% avoidable.
Amid all the breathless media coverage of the Brexit battles in Cabinet and Brussels - people need to remember that devolution &amp; the Good Friday Agreement itself are in jeopardy here. It will utterly unforgivable if that hard-won settlement is broken by Brexit.
If we‚Äôd put folic acid in flour (like the USA, Australia, Canada and 80 other countries) after 1991 when evidence of benefits first emerged, we‚Äôd have saved 3000 babies from suffering Spina Bifida and other birth defects. Evidence base policy. At last. https://t.co/iFRrJZDDMw
Folic acid to be added to UK flour to reduce Spina bifida and other birth defects - Great announcement just before the debate I had secured on the issue for Oct 25th. Really looking forward to it now, @SteveBrineMP https://t.co/iFRrJZDDMw
@RhonddaBryant Thanks, Chris. Thanks too due to @JeffRookerj @NigelDoddsDUP @SteveBrineMP @ShineKateSteele and all the parents, DRs and experts who have called for this for so long!
@BDA_Dietitians @JeffRookerj Thank you - but Jeff has led the way on this campaign for a long time - and many parents, more importantly, have called for this. Their campaign will be rewarded by saving the lives of the many babies that might otherwise have been affected.
@ShineKateSteele @guardian @SHINEUKCharity Great news Kate! Well done to all Shine campaigners who have been pushing for this since 1991! Thousands of babies will benefit from this change in future!
BIG NEWS BREAKING! Govt to legislate to add Folic acid to UK flour to reduce incidence of Spina bifida and anencephaly - 6 months after we set up a campaign for it. Result! Well done @NigelDoddsDUP @JeffRookerj @ShineKateSteele &amp; kudos to @SteveBrineMP https://t.co/iFRrJZDDMw

At least Plaid are being honest under new management about their aim of carving Wales out of the UK. Though the logic of responding to Brexit isolationism by isolating Wales within the UK too is lost on me. As, no doubt, it would be on the people of Wales. https://t.co/4EWCr0z9zf

@proseccolover @hqcrew1 It was my pleasure, as ever.
The irony of Teresa May championing the cause of Open Trade and Freedom for the individual even as she isolates us from our main trading partners and removes our people‚Äôs freedom to travel work and live abroad. Funny if not so tragic.
@AndrewMorganRCT Great stuff! And just the beginning of Ponty‚Äôs regeneration! Congratulations to our Council for showing the vision to lead on these developments.
@sionbarry Looking forward to welcoming you, Sion.
Theresa May‚Äôs claim that ‚ÄòBrexit Britain is full of promise‚Äô doesn‚Äôt exactly fill me with hope. We‚Äôve heard Tory promises before.
Did I hear that right, @BBCr4today ? Brexiteer @SteveBakerHW just referred to US Chlorinated Chicken as ‚Äòclean chicken‚Äô? You have got to admire Brexit chutzpah, eh?
So is Mrs May going to unveil a new plan for the NI Border today or what? @BBCr4today It was trailed in the press overnight, but now she says she‚Äôs ‚Äòworking up the details‚Äô!?! Fair play, though, she‚Äôs only had 830 days, 10 hours and 29 minutes to work it out.
PM says she‚Äôll ‚Äòcontrol people coming to the UK from the EU as we do from the rest of the World.‚Äô Tbh, I don‚Äôt remember anyone complaining to me about EU migrants in 2016. The sad truth is that people raised migration from Asia, Africa &amp; Middle East - unaffected by these changes
The Tories‚Äô nativist transformation is complete this morning as their Prime Minister celebrates ending a measure of freedom enjoyed by our people in order to shun foreigners.
Tory Conference highlights so far: 1. The British Foreign Secretary compares the EU to Stalin‚Äôs Russia. 2. The Chancellor unveils plan for permanent austerity:Tax rises &amp; a 10th year of public service cuts. 3. Boris Johnson lies about wheat. ...and it‚Äôs only day two, folks!
Now ‚Äòfour days quarantine‚Äô is being discussed for pets travelling abroad after Brexit. Wilf doesn‚Äôt remember reading that on the bus and he‚Äôs not amused. He‚Äôll be protesting at the @wooferendum on Sunday. https://t.co/IIemq9ZFbz

First class speech by @Keir_Starmer rightly applauded for its clarity and strength of purpose. Labour must not vote for this Tory Brexit.

‚ÄòThe party that said they‚Äôd fix the roof while the sun was shining, now says they‚Äôll burn the whole house down!‚Äô @Keir_Starmer captures perfectly the catastrophe of a blind Tory Brexit - and confirms we‚Äôll vote against it. Bravo! https://t.co/R9VpHr81x4

Conference resolved in 2016: ‚ÄúUnless the final settlement proves to be acceptable then the option of retaining EU membership should be retained. The final settlement should be subject to approval, through Parliament &amp; potentially through a general election or a referendum.‚Äù
I‚Äôm delighted if Jeremy Corbyn will now listen to members &amp; back a People‚Äôs Vote. But let‚Äôs not forget @UKLabour Conference voted for a motion in 2016 to put the final deal to a public vote or General Election. We just then quietly ignored the first part...1/2
@lt_2190 No, it didn‚Äôt. RCT as a whole voted  to leave, Ponty voted to Remain: 53-47%
@Panopticon6 You‚Äôd have a point if we hadn‚Äôt backed it already at conference in 2016 - and then ignored it. Keep up.

The Tory Party spends 40 years fighting over Europe and blaming ‚ÄòBrussels‚Äô for our every ill. Then finds it hasn‚Äôt got a clue how European governments are likely to respond to Brexit and so buggers up the negotiations. I am shocked.

@LlantrisantNews @RCTCouncil @LlantrisantCC @MickAntoniw1 No, Dean, as I told you when we last spoke, RCT is carrying out a traffic survey now that schools are back in order to have an idea of the traffic at busiest times. They are also working up options that might be put to residents.
@hjoneshojo Although I knew Michael Foot. Unlike you.
Times splash suggesting Michael Foot was a spy is utter rubbish &amp; designed to attack the current Labour leadership by association. It misleads in every sense. Foot was a patriot, a mighty intellect, and Labour to his boots. Corbyn neither reflects nor less inherits Foot‚Äôs legacy.

This thread - and these policy prescriptions - well worth a read. Important new report from the @IPPR https://t.co/cNWnH3L4Zw
I argued for these and similar policies in 2016 and Archbishop Welby is to be commended for using his pulpit to preach for more equal, progressive, fair and tolerant Britain. Bravo! https://t.co/sCSadaTpdw
Excellent to see the leader of our Council @AndrewMorganRCT calling for a @peoplesvote_uk on the final Brexit Deal. He‚Äôs üíØ % correct - this Brexit Deal will make our constituents right across RCT poorer and our public services weaker. That‚Äôs not what anyone voted for. https://t.co/trzfgBFuhJ
This is leadership. Well done  @Tim_Roache &amp; @GMB_union - ‚Äòwhen our Union negotiates a pay deal we then ask the members if they want to accept or reject that deal‚Äô Dead right - and the same democratic choice should be given on the Brexit Deal. https://t.co/ap3EXfDkCP
Unfortunately, the Govt response is defending the charges, denying that they are profiteering and repeating the excuse that eligible children can get access to benefits by simply securing indefinite leave to remain, not citizenship status. Have they learned nothing from #Windrush
Good to be back in Parliament &amp; to speak this morning against the iniquitous charging of ¬£1000 fees by Govt for registration of children entitled to be UK Citizens. The Tories have doubled those fees, making ¬£100m profit in the process, as part of now infamous Hostile Environment
Labour‚Äôs NEC should adopt the IHRA definition and examples of anti-semitism. Today. And without amendments or caveats.
With new data showing 1.6 million Leave voters now back Remain, it‚Äôs clear that backing a vote on the Brexit Deal would be electorally advantageous for @UKLabour - as well as being the right thing to do for our country.  Come on Corbyn! https://t.co/5LnygcJqzz
BREXIT REALITY CHECK: The UK Economy is already 2% smaller than it would be without Brexit -  that‚Äôs what the more optimistic forecasts predicted the ENTIRE impact of Brexit would be, despite the fact we haven‚Äôt left yet! @telegraph https://t.co/8ScSJQCBzt

Mmmm. He seemed quite sanguine about the prospect of a split when I last discussed it with him. https://t.co/DwvHCZ7c5Y
If @UKLabour leadership truly wants to win power and redistribute wealth then forcing and winning a @peoplesvote_uk holds the key. Holding the vote would galvanise our support, split the Tories &amp; eject Mrs May. Winning it would save our economy from another decade of austerity.

Good luck to everyone getting your GCSE results today across RCT. Thanks to all our pupils, parents and teachers for your hard work and support!
Keir is absolutely right. A @peoplesvote_uk has to be one of the options open to Parliament if the Brexit Deal on offer is disastrous and has to be rejected. Democractic options can‚Äôt be curtailed because of foolish talk about civil disobedience. https://t.co/ArNdMxBY7L
@Channel4News Good question.
@peterkyle @George_Osborne Spot on, Peter. Yet another illustration of Brexit diminishing Britain.
@AllTheTimeRef @KatieGupwell Absolutely! What would Ponty be without the Gamberini family? Or the Orsi‚Äôs, or the Marenghi‚Äôs or Servini‚Äôs or Cruci‚Äôs? Lesser, is what.
It‚Äôs worse than our ‚Äònot having woken up to it‚Äô - some in our politics (Boris Johnson just last week) are fully alive to the threat, and their capacity to exploit and enable it. https://t.co/Ob3yw1c8qP
Great to see @vaughangething speaking so powerfully about the need for a @peoplesvote_uk on the Brexit Deal. Wales will be among the hardest hit by Brexit and Labour should tell that truth - and give people a chance to avert this catastrophe. https://t.co/KH07aJtxjz

@spirulla @PaulSandars @UKLabour Er, 6 out of the 9 people I list are women.
What a desperate illustration of our self-inflicted wounds that the top story on the news this morning is not Labour‚Äôs condemnation of 10 years of Tory Austerity and the near collapse of Northants Council, but rather the anti-semitism swirling around our leader.
The NEC has a hugely important role in restoring @UKLabour to health and preparing us for government. I think the right team to do that is Wimbury, Baxter, Black, Beckett, Izzard, Akehurst, Gurinder-Josan, Cazimoglu &amp; Peto. Please support them.
We need to listen to the activists. Perhaps we could pilot our new online policy making process by asking them if they‚Äôd like us to oppose Brexit? #justathoughtjeremy https://t.co/QeMbusUmlt

A good victory for common sense as Parliament voted tonight to stay in bodies that get new drugs to patients - but in all other important votes the ERG coup within the Tory Party was evident. May has capitulated at every turn and Chequers is now in tatters.
@darrenpjones I fully support this call for an Inquiry. The referendum was rigged.
Even the Tories here in the Commons Chamber are now referring to their colleagues who ran the Leave campaign as ‚Äòshysters and charalatans‚Äô! The referendum was rigged, that much is clear, and should be re-run if democracy is to be served #PeoplesVote
Massive NIO recruitment drive signals 'direct rule by stealth' via @irish_news https://t.co/1OtTnUxkbk
So, No. 10 has definitively ruled out, under any circumstances, a further referendum on the final Brexit Deal...Time for the bookies to start shortening the odds on the #PeoplesVote I‚Äôd say.  #fullconfidenceinthemanager
@sonofr Yep. I agree with Justine. Have done for 2 years now.

@MrRBourne Thanks ‚ÄòProfessor‚Äô.
@shuan_longbeard Balls
@DilipShah2016 Thanks Dilip, though I was as referring to the prospect of the UK joining the TPP, long advocated by Liam Fox and Boris Johnson and floated (as a sop to the Brexiteers) by the PM in her statement on Monday. Irony clearly not your strong suit.
@campbellclaret I fear that is true. And it‚Äôs unconscionable.
@andrew_lilico Well, you could put it that it was ludicrous of Mrs May to offer the prospect of Britain joining the Trans Pacific Partnership as a sop to sulky Brexiteers (like her pal, Liam Fox) in her Chequers statement on Monday. Pay attention!
@MrRBourne No, a guy with a Chair in Public understanding doesn‚Äôt catch a reference to the ‚Äòpossible accession (by the UK) to the Trans Pacific Partnership‚Äô floated (ludicrously) by our PM on Monday and long advocated by our Trade Secretary, Liam Fox. Keep up.
@WillumG Er no, I was referring to the ‚Äòpossible accession to the Trans Pacific Partnership (by the UK)‚Äô referenced by the PM (and long advocated by Liam Fox) in her Chequers statement on Monday, mate.
Trump and Putin seem evermore like 2 sides of the same coin: agents provocateurs, seeking to divide and weaken the EU, interfering in the politics of our sovereign state, supporting the wreckers within. America may be our ally. This man is not.
We‚Äôve now had a week of violence  in Derry/Londonderry with almost no comment by our appallingly complacent Government. How much more violence do we need to see before the Tories make a serious effort to revive the Talks, restore devolution and fill the vacuum?
The idea of a US deal to replace the losses in EU trade was always fantasy. And Boris, Farage, Fox &amp; all Trump‚Äôs other poodles knew it. So it‚Äôs no surprise that he‚Äôs helped them out of a hole by claiming May has blown it. It‚Äôs the Alt-Right Trans-Pacific Partnership in action! https://t.co/NpKs5YG8PX
@Poshtag Don‚Äôt need to see the future - we‚Äôve devalued the pound by 15%, receipts are down, our share of FDI has fallen, manufacturing output has weakened, trade balance in goods has worsened and the OBR says public finances are reduced by ¬£15Bn pa. But apart from that, Brexit is Brill!
I discussed this issue with the @AndrewMorganRCT our Council Leader on Friday and we are looking at exactly what we can do to calm the traffic. I‚Äôm also going to hold a meeting locally with Glynne Holmes to discuss matters with residents. Details to follow soon. https://t.co/NKVifQS8Hp

@bighumphs Have they nicked it?
Love this description in the papers today of England‚Äôs success at corners: ‚ÄòQueueing while pointing out foreigners committing infractions of etiquette, of course, has been an English strength for years; Southgate‚Äôs genius has been to weaponise it.‚Äô #CmonEngland!
@EmmaHardyMP Definitely
@rhiandoyle67 No, we are urging the Government to review hero mesh too. The fact that there are no NICE guidelines is a scandal.
'The issue is not with the product but with clinical practice'....'the advice I have received from the MHRA is that Mesh is still the best product for treating stress incontinence' - @JackieDP Health Minister, Hansard 18/10/11 - the same Minister who announces today's suspension!
But questions still need to be asked as to why Ministers were defending the use of mesh just a few months ago? And why it has taken an independent inquiry (only provided after a massive campaign) to recommend suspension when the MHRA or NICE could have done so themselves?
Hugely welcome announcement by Health Minister @JackieDP that the use of Mesh to treat incontinence is to be suspended until a series of measures - which bear a remarkable similarity to those suggested by the APPG a year ago - are implemented. 1/2 https://t.co/joKQZnYYDo
Government decision to suspend Mesh is welcome and overdue but raises significant questions about our regulators, the MHRA and NICE. Why did they not listen to the worries about Mesh? Why did it take a sustained campaign and an independent review to act? https://t.co/XSrA2T2dpL
.@JuliaCumberlege should be applauded today for the rapid decision by her review to recommend suspension of mesh - and for persuading the Government to accept her advice. Bravo!
Very, very good question. https://t.co/Av99ohgzWV

Gotta love Jeremy Hunt warning on @BBCr4today that ‚Äòwe risk having Brexit paralysis‚Äô.  He‚Äôs a reminder to us all of the importance of keeping your sense of humour!
Britain deserves better than this Government and their chaotic Brexit. If they can‚Äôt even agree among themselves, how can the rest of us have any faith in the deal? We must now have a @peoplesvote_uk
@ChrisRogersHK @LPrivileged Well best chow down then - as those numbers show (as I said) Ponty voting remain (versus Ogmore, Islwtn etc that voted leave). Keep up.
@ChrisRogersHK @LPrivileged You seem really boring and obsessive, so I‚Äôll only bother to respond this once. RCT voted leave, Ponty voted Remain according to the only two academic studies done. Here‚Äôs the link to UEA‚Äôs study: https://t.co/rbGuA60e13
Keir is right to say we should keep all options on the table. But it‚Äôs utterly clear after Chequers that NO option is better than Remaining in the EU - which is why we should embrace a @peoplesvote_uk as the only viable means of delivering the best deal for Britain: EU membership https://t.co/R92G2b0jr3
A real privilege to join our council leaders @AndrewMorganRCT &amp; @CllrMWebber for today‚Äôs #ArmedForcesDay commemorations in Ynysangharad War Memorial Park. https://t.co/6ORJ2ib5M9
@AndrewMorganRCT What was the name of that character from CHIPS?
@ChrisRogersHK @LPrivileged No they didn‚Äôt. Pontypridd voted to Remain: 53-47.
The real danger with this fudge is that is designed to be rejected by The EU  - thereby allowing the Brexiteers to blame Brussels and claim there‚Äôs no alternative than the ‚ÄòNo Deal‚Äô they‚Äôve wanted all along. That, not fear of Mrs May, explains their silence 2/2
So, we stay in the SM for goods, we abide by EU rules and have regard to EU courts and we retain mobility of labour. Take back control (of the rules governing services) is a lot less catchy than the original, eh? 1/2

Parliament has been sidelined today. On the most important issue facing our country for generations. So much for taking back control.
It seems clear to me that we are being sold a pig in a poke today and there will be no meaningful vote or an amendable motion that might allow Parliament to save the people from the ‚ÄòNo Deal‚Äô Brexit that the hardliners are determined to deliver.

So, the Government is set to lose ¬£10Bn pa in tax revenues from The City because of Brexit - but it‚Äôs OK because we‚Äôll all get to help make up the difference by paying our new ‚Äòjumbo Brexit Dividend‚Äô taxes. That seems like a good deal to me! https://t.co/tOStZ2zIGC

@Adref_Info @hayleyj67296570 @alunmichael @AndrewMorganRCT @RCTCouncil I am seeking a meeting with the police and residents as soon as is possible. I will invite Adref to attend.
It tells you all you need to know about this Government that we have been left with NO time to discuss the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland - despite the fact that a hard border jeopardises peace and prosperity in Ireland. Unconscionable.
Bravo @DrPhillipLeeMP for his principled and courageous stand. He is right to say Brexit will damage the people of this country and they we should both pause or revoke Article 50 and put the final deal to a #PeoplesVote
@scoobiesnack0 There won‚Äôt be any savings. Even with the best Free Trade Deal the Government can conceive of they concede that our economy will shrink by 2%. Costing us ¬£38Bn PA in extra borrowing. So that‚Äôs ¬£38Bn less to spend on Manufacturing. Or the NHS. #BrexitReality

Brexiteer ultras like David Davis just need to accept that their hostility to the EU cannot force a hard border on Ireland. Alignment with the Customs Union (or staying in it, in other words) is the price the Brexiteers must pay for peace.
@RhonddaBryant He‚Äôs not coming to Ponty, is he? I‚Äôve forgotten where we put the bunting!

Lots of people contacting me about amendment 19a of the EU Withdrawal Bill. Happy to add my name in support of a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal.
Now that we know 13 Tory rebels are prepared to vote for continued membership of the EEA, Labour will surely take this opportunity to defeat the Government and vote for the EEA to mitigate the damage Brexit is set to do Britain???
Just as there‚Äôs no such thing as a ‚Äòjobs first Brexit‚Äô neither is there any chance of ‚Äòfull access‚Äô to the Single Market without being a member. Instead of this fudge, Labour should be opposing the Tories Brexit fiasco and offering the people a vote to #StopBrexit

@mahri_mac @lucianaberger @RuthSmeeth @IvanLewis_MP @margarethodge @IanAustinMP @MikeKaneMP @joanryanEnfield @UKLabour Utterly untrue. The truth is that there‚Äôs always been antisemitism on the hard left of politics in the UK (and globally) but what is new and shameful is that the the influx of the hard left into Labour to support Jeremy Corbyn has imported that antisemitism into our party.
Searing, shaming, vital speeches by @lucianaberger @RuthSmeeth @IvanLewis_MP @margarethodge @IanAustinMP @MikeKaneMP @joanryanEnfield &amp; so many others - speaking truth about the appalling reality of  #antisemitism on the hard left &amp; now, shamefully, in @UKLabour #enoughisenough
Good piece by @rafaelbehr on the clear danger that we sleepwalk to Brexit - and the diminished country which lies beyond it. Parliament, Labour in particular, needs to wake up, press for a @peoplesvote_uk - and then fight to stay in!  https//:https://t.co/rja0sRB2hK
The House of Commons is elected to represent the people of our country and to hold our Executive to account. Parliament should have been recalled and consulted before we engaged in this military action in Syria.

@jonw101961 @atmphillips @MikeNicholas2 No, that‚Äôs not true. RCT in aggregate voted leave, Pontypridd voted to Remain (54-46). You can look it up here: https://t.co/ZDF6ick80r
@HeidiOwen12 @David__Osland Agreed.
@tomdouglas16 @David__Osland @georgegalloway No. Ponty voted 54-46 remain. Thanks for your concern though.
@ursula0703 @David__Osland @relovedreams No, for the umpteenth time, they didn‚Äôt. Ponty voted 54-46 Remain. The wider council area (including 2 other constituencies)voted narrowly to leave.
@wiseoldsoc @atmphillips @MikeNicholas2 I did. I led Labour‚Äôs opposition at 3rd Reading and secured the ¬£4.4Bn U-Turn on PIP cuts. Look it up.

Excellent piece by someone who helped deliver the Good Friday Agreement, and knows its value. https://t.co/i6M6LHPUJH
This is completely wrong from Davis (again). Enda Kenny, the former Taoiseach, consistently warned about Brexit and the border - as did Arlene Foster in her joint letter with McGuinness before Stormont‚Äôs collapse. https://t.co/LMjDyisCCc https://t.co/9rFtIMrmgQ
David Davis‚Äô claim in @thetimes this morning that concerns about Brexit &amp; the Irish Border only emerged with the collapse of Stormont and the new Taoiseach are utter rubbish. Enda Kenny, Martin McGuinness AND Arlene Foster all warned about it.
I couldn‚Äôt possibly comment...#StopBrexit https://t.co/Ws1Asg0o2Q
@David__Osland No, regretfully, I accepted the ‚Äòcollective responsibility‚Äô &amp; party line on that - but then changed Labour‚Äôs position as Shadow DWP Sec, opposed the Bill entirely at 3rd reading, and secured the ¬£4.4Bn U-Turn on PIP cuts. Don‚Äôt regret my vote against JC‚Äôs whip on Art. 50 though.
On the Good Friday Agreement‚Äôs 20th anniversary, Labour should be defending and sustaining it, not joining the Tory Brexiteers in downplaying its importance and the risks of a hard border. https://t.co/Y9d9RJ0adk

This is, in part, why I wrote the piece which led to my sacking last week. We are in danger of sleepwalking into supporting the Tories Brexit debacle.

‚ÄòWe have had no visibility of any technical solutions, anywhere in the world, beyond the aspirational, that would remove the need for physical infrastructure at the border.‚Äô NI Committee deeply sceptical about ‚Äòtech solutions‚Äô, but says CU and SM solves the problem in transition.

I fully accept that money, contractual obligations &amp; self interest precludes a return to the days before super-club control, the end of promotion and relegation &amp; meaningful matches every weekend. But don‚Äôt tell me what we‚Äôve got is good, or better. The emperor has no clothes 3/3
The recent success (&amp; great play!) of the Scarlets, the former success of Wales, ‚ÄòJudgement Day‚Äô crowds, Ospreys‚Äô efforts at outreach - none of these = success for the concept of regionalism. Nor does the bogus ‚Äòthere was no alternative‚Äô argument hold any water. 2/3
At risk of further exercising Regional fans, my often stated view is that Regional Rugby was an unnecessary mistake &amp; has failed. Financially fragile, unloved by a majority, little watched on TV or terrace, producing too few players for Wales &amp; divorced from the grassroots 1/3
Perhaps this will mean the BBC spends more time covering proper rugby between traditional clubs, hastening the demise of the failed regional rugby experiment? Every cloud...https://t.co/cTCK2vhimP
If this is true, it‚Äôs completely out of order and I will absolutely call for reimbursement- however, I gather the Health Boards state that it‚Äôs not true....I will find out. Thanks for volunteering! https://t.co/rmYP8PAzbP
Is that it?
PM repeats that she is prepared to end up with ‚ÄòNo Deal‚Äô (or falling out on WTO terms). Has she not read her own Government‚Äôs assessments which show that would wipe about 10% off GDP? That‚Äôs c.¬£180,000,000,000 btw.
So, apart from the Freudian slip about wanting a hard border (!) nothing new on NI - just a rehashing of last summer‚Äôs suggestion of opting small biz out of checks and a ‚Äòtrusted traders‚Äô scheme for big biz, facilitated by ‚Äòtechnology‚Äô...an approach David Davis called ‚Äòblue-sky‚Äô!
PM: ‚ÄòIn certain ways access to each others markets will be less than now‚Äô - Rather different to David Davis‚Äô promise that we‚Äôd have the ‚Äòexact same benefits‚Äô as when in Single Market.
Good luck! https://t.co/AGCRIoKCKS

This is an important intervention by a man who was instrumental in the Northern Ireland peace process. His party should pay heed. https://t.co/5TtKrti7cV
Extraordinarily, Boris Johnson has just scuttled out of the Commons Chamber - running away from his responsibility to defend his irresponsible and reckless remarks about the N. Irish Border.
@DMcCaffreySKY @BorisJohnson Yes
Here‚Äôs what Johnson used to say: ‚ÄúThere can be no return to a hard border. There can be no hard border. That would be unthinkable, and it would be economic and political madness".   Now he says NOT Govt‚Äôs job to avoid a hard border! The man‚Äôs duplicitous, untrustworthy &amp; reckless
If true, then Johnson's recklessness with our relationship the Republic &amp; the future of the GFA must be addressed by the PM. This man's ego and his Brexit-at-any-cost strategy cannot be allowed to jeopardise peace. Mrs May should sack him before he does any more damage. https://t.co/fvzVSrEisG
And though Johnson may be a joke, I‚Äôm afraid there is nothing funny about his glib comparison between London borough borders and that in Ireland. Preserving an open border, without infrastructure, is a matter of the utmost importance - for peace and prosperity in Ireland.
What a crass and thoughtless statement by our Foreign Secretary. Dismissing and insulting all who are worrying about how to resolve the Brexit / Irish border issue and to preserve the GFA. https://t.co/lCt22BnN2w
Good to see Boris Johnson obliged to address the issue of the Irish Border for the first time on @BBCr4today . Shame he had absolutely nothing sensible to say about it.
Important speech by @jeremycorbyn today: Being in a Customs Union with the EU and maintaining a strong, ongoing relationship with the Single Market are both vital to preserve the Good Friday Agreement and to protect jobs &amp; rights in GB and Northern Ireland.
Excellent piece by Fintan O‚ÄôToole on why Britain must remain aligned to the Customs Union and Single Market to protect the Belfast Agreement and preserve peace in Ireland. @OwenPaterson @DanielJHannan &amp; @KateHoeyMP should read it and reflect. https://t.co/eOQDLPq04z

Dead right - as you have been throughout this brilliant, winning campaign! https://t.co/W1YfuLdDgM
Good to hear Jeremy Hunt state with such clarity that he wants to ‚Äòget it right‚Äô on #mesh. It‚Äôs a shame he rejected our call to suspend Mesh until NICE and his review reports - but today‚Äôs announcement is a step forward. Mesh campaigners are being heard by government!
Old news that there is to be an audit in England into #mesh though new and important announcement today that there will be a registry recording any and all use of #mesh in future - and a further review of Mesh by Baroness Cumberledge. Her remit will need to be scrutinised.
Fantastic, very welcome news that the Prime Minister has just announced a review into medical devices, including vaginal #mesh. Another victory for all those who have campaigned so hard, especially all @slingthemesh &amp; @KathSansom

Welcome news that the families of the victims of the Hyde Park bomb - including one of my own constituents - have won their battle for legal aid. The right decision.
Pretty extraordinary that the SOSNI wasn‚Äôt already on the committee considering Brexit, given the significance of the Irish Border. https://t.co/uVQShSCxv6
And he is right. https://t.co/0ShuRb9bDV
‚ÄòIn the absence of agreed solutions, the UK will maintain full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union which, now or in the future, support North-South cooperation‚Äô  The commitment made last year is clearly at odds with today‚Äôs categoric statement.
Tory ignorance and complacency about Ireland exemplified by @KwasiKwarteng on @BBCr4today - any hardening of the Border will have significant and negative ramifications for the ongoing, incomplete peace process. And must be avoided at all costs.
It is categorically irresponsible of No 10 to unveil this cavalier attitude to the Irish Border on the very day All-Party Talks resume in Belfast. Northern Ireland appears to be just an afterthought for this government.
Very hard to see how this can be reconciled with their promise of no hard border in Ireland. Peace  is being risked for the politics of the Tory party. https://t.co/4HmalvKRNQ

@julieloxley1 @miJemima @MeshAwareness Well, it should pick up all those since 2005 who had the initial op done on the NHS and thereafter attended any NHS out patient appointments for pain or complications as well as removal. It won‚Äôt pick up the number of women who went private for removal.
@SWPTaff @swpspecials The entire community is grateful for their brilliant service!
@KarenPreater @RichardMMilne @wgcs_health Well, Welsh MPs had a briefing note from WG this week which detailed how many mesh ops had been undertaken 2007-2017 and how many partial or full removals - eg 222 in 2017 with 20 removed subsequently.
@RichardMMilne @miJemima No, I don‚Äôt agree Richard. We have been calling for this audit for 2 years. It will tell us how many women have been treated with mesh and how many have had problems as a consequence. 2 crucial facts that we currently lack.
@RichardMMilne Richard, individual patients will not be contacted or identified. This is an electronic audit using the anonymised hospital episode codes. Wales is doing similar.
@ATownNews @newbelfast @OMuirighSols @squinteratn @puntersg @pomuirigh @bronachtwomey @ballymurphy11 @BallymurphySF @BallymurphyDoc @sean_murray1 @TrevorLunnLV @cllrtimattwood @GerryCarrollPBP @Neekyatn It was good to meet them all, and to hear their tragic story first hand.
@PontyMuseum @RhonddaHeritage I‚Äôve been in love with the Llanover for 30-odd years!
@miJemima @julieloxley1 @MeshAwareness Hopefully they will be, as what they plan to do is first identify all women in England who have undergone any prolapse or SUI operation using mesh and then track their journey in the NHS - including any further ops or treatment for pain, urological or neurological etc issues.
Great initiative by @RCTCouncil. The route is already really popular with the local community. https://t.co/06i0kce7Ye
Excellent meeting with T√†naiste @simoncoveney today - clear and compelling on the vital importance of an invisible border in Ireland, for peace and prosperity. And on how little time we have to decide how we will achieve it.
@scully1066 @ChukaUmunna @eurelationsappg I agree and I do!
@D00DLEBUG1 Because they don‚Äôt have electronic records, they say, prior to that. And this is an electronic audit.
@DebraMichael19 This will be England-only, I‚Äôm afraid. I think the Welsh and Scottish Government should follow suit though.
The decision by Government to accept the need for a full investigation into #mesh complication rates is hugely welcome. We need to know how many women have undergone surgery, and how many have had major complications as a result. https://t.co/YdfslKTUb0
@shirleyjones999 They haven‚Äôt agreed yet to include Hernia mesh in the audit.
Good coverage in the Daily Mail on today‚Äôs important announcement that the Government is to investigate the scale of the problem with #Mesh https://t.co/H2i9rl46yN
Delighted the government has listened to the APPG on Surgical Mesh Implants and @MeshCampaign and has now agreed to conduct full investigation into mesh. Here's our press release with all the details. https://t.co/pHd2DxVAfe
@jolloyd19 I believe it is because the ‚Äòcoding‚Äô of the interventions didn‚Äôt exist in a form that can be audited electronically prior to 2005.
Leaked Brexit impact assessment shows Northern Ireland will be one of the hardest hit regions of the UK - even without taking into account the effect of a hard border.
Hope the Welsh and Scottish Governments follow suit and conduct full audits for Wales and Scotland.

Workers at #Bombardier will be delighted tonight. They and the company are wholly vindicated by the ITC decision. They will know that their unions - especially Steve Turner and all @unitetheunion worked incredibly hard to win this.
Fantastic news that #Bombardier has won its case at the ITC tonight - absolutely the right decision. Well done to @unitetheunion and @GMB_union for the brilliant job they have done protecting jobs in Belfast.

Thanks to @nivictimscom Judith Thompson for inviting me to share this morning with victims and survivors of The Troubles - it was a salutary reminder of why today‚Äôs politicians must rebuild trust and maintain the peace process.
Congratulations to Tommy McAvoy on his election! https://t.co/SDUX3PiEe9
Looking forward to an important meeting this afternoon between the APPG on #Mesh and Department of Health Ministers. Hopeful of making progress on some key issues. Will update after the meeting. #slingthemesh
A positive and welcome move by the NIO to recruit a senior policy adviser on Rights and Equality, including on the vital and pressing issues of equal marriage and abortion. https://t.co/kilG3qk7Ec
First #Bombardier was hit by Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô protectionism, now other countries and sectors are being targeted by his trade warriors: https://t.co/1CxLvm5ptK
It‚Äôs a year to the day since the publication of the landmark Historical Abuse Inquiry in Northern Ireland  - and not a single one of the recommendations have been enacted! Another reason NI‚Äôs politicians must revive power-sharing. #SAVIA https://t.co/yvMbJqvBHh
@Labour4IndWales It‚Äôs tipping down here in Llantrisant. I‚Äôll get the buckets out quick!
Great job, Karen!! https://t.co/mjeyJRHTfN
@neilsmithgmb @GMBNI @PaulMaccaGMB @mikejmhinch @deniseNWI @gmbx02 @rossgmb2018 Great. I‚Äôve asked the office to get in touch to arrange a meeting for next Thursday/ Friday
New NI Secretary, Karen Bradley, must show her support for #Bombardier workers threatened by Trump‚Äôs protectionist policies. I‚Äôve written to her today, asking that she meet the Unions and intervene personally even at this late hour @unitetheunion @GMB_union https://t.co/KaKpHok38X
Absolutely right! And I‚Äôm  planning to meet again with @GMB_union in NI next week to discuss. The movement has been united and resolute - unlike the Tories. https://t.co/qaPNeFZoyZ
Great to see @unitetheunion standing strong for #Bombardier workers in Belfast today, in stark contrast with the Government. New Secretary of State, Karen Bradley should be meeting with Unions and workforce ASAP to explain what the Govt is doing to help win their case on the 25th
@coreyfrench Email: Owen.smith.mp@parliament.uk
@ChiDeltaWithNOR @KevinPMeagher No, I think that is a thoughtless and insensitive thing to say. I‚Äôm sure he meant no offence, but we all need to choose our words carefully - as I have learned to my cost on occasion.
Pleased to see that Karen Bradley is moving swiftly to start talks at Stormont. But we need new energy and a new approach. She should seek additional support of an independent chair and the involvement of the smaller parties who were frozen out last year. https://t.co/HDeS5DU2kj
@NIHRC Great to see you today and to hear about the excellent work being undertaken by the Commission.
@JBrokenshire Good luck! Lots of good wishes sent for you from everyone I met in Belfast over the last few days.
A year to the day Stormont collapsed, Labour was in Belfast today with the leaders of all 5 main parties in Northern Ireland, discussing how we revive the Executive and Assembly. https://t.co/9XlOwn2Yh5

@TrivallisCEO We had been in touch with Mr Pounder and the Post Office over Xmas. The P.O. have given a written commitment to maintain the service in town - the issue is now how long it will take to sort out the liquidation and the new ownership.
Lots of concern about Pontypridd Post Office.  I‚Äôve been assured that the closure is temporary but have today asked for the UK Government to take urgent action to help Post Office Limited reopen the town centre branch as soon as possible. https://t.co/CkxIWb7Uir
Theresa May would have been better off defending Bombardier jobs in Belfast this week instead of bodging her reshuffle, as candid Minister concedes that President Trump has ignored her feeble attempt to protect NI jobs from his aggressive America-first policies https://t.co/hbi4Bw8bVr

Very sorry to hear that @JBrokenshire is unwell and has left the Cabinet. I, and I‚Äôm sure all in Northern Ireland, thank James for his diligent service and wish him a speedy recovery.

The scale of this issue can‚Äôt be brushed under the carpet any longer. In 2018, we need to see a decisive intervention in this debate by UK Health Ministers, NICE and MHRA. New Zealand has led the way with their ban. https://t.co/WnbqtofHZo

@stebrett @YPantSchool Yes - a brilliant effort. And, unfortunately, so needed!
@gaz_boyle Yes.
New NI political donor rules ‚Äòstink‚Äô, say Labour https://t.co/hEE8seNtqg
Labour voted against the Government's plans to not make past donations to political parties in Northern Ireland transparent, and challenged them to go away and think again https://t.co/EIiTEsZEdM
Yesterday the Government voted to restrict transparency and exclude from publication the DUP donation from the EU referendum - the largest donation in the history of Northern Ireland politics https://t.co/H1kvMDocY1
This is a very disappointing finding. And out of kilter with emerging evidence about dangers of #mesh https://t.co/X2aEOuxPCI
On marriage equality, I will call on the Tories to use Direct Rule (if introduced) to legislate in line with decision taken by the NI Assembly in Nov 2015 to extend equality to NI. On that there is an expression of agreement. On abortion there isn‚Äôt. We need progress on both.
Richard, this would be a good story and fair point to make. If it were true. It isn‚Äôt. Labour is not planning to call for a referendum on marriage - though there is a case for one on extending abortion legislation to NI, as a means of pressing change while respecting devolution. https://t.co/gdleLvuVtC
Labour criticises move to let past donations to DUP stay hidden https://t.co/VI9h0WRiMt
The fruits of another dodgy deal between the Government and the DUP this afternoon when Tories block transparency rules that would reveal the source of the ‚Äòdark money‚Äô behind Brexit. https://t.co/jesad2x7Rr

@raerhi No, but we‚Äôre not planning to call for a referendum on this at all.
@CraigBJonesLab @LGBTLabour People should really take time to ask me if this were true first though, eh? As it isn‚Äôt.
@LGBTLabour We‚Äôre not planning to call for a referendum on this issue at all. The story is wrong.
@LukeYoung @UKLabour We‚Äôre not.
@MrEric_Turner No, they only case the singled out as an exception was Hernia, where they maintained that benefits outweigh risk.
Excellent set of #PMQs questions by @jeremycorbyn today, exposing the abject record of The Tories on Housing. Mrs May looked clueless and without conviction in her response.
@Edwards_travel @BBCNews @BBCWalesNews @ITVWales @gtfm1079 @MickAntoniw1 @fmwales @WalesBusiness @TravelineCymru @BusinessinWales This is totally unacceptable. I am getting in touch with @SWPTaff to make sure this is being followed up and measures put in place to prevent any repeat.
@lesley_clouter @MeshCampaign @BBCPanorama I think that is a concern for many of us Lesley. We just need the regulators to make the right decisions and ban or at least suspend use of Mesh until they are clear on risks and benefits. NZ says risks outweigh benefits.
Good report in the Guardian on New Zealand‚Äôs decision to ban TVT surgical mesh - a victory for campaigners the World over. UK must follow suit. https://t.co/DYl4iIHzg6
@BBCPanorama @Meshgirlni True. But I think the issue you highlight- the poor quality and volume of data - is what explains concerns that the programme seemed to suggest that@mesh injuries were a ‚Äòminority‚Äô issue. NZ has banned Mesh because ‚Äòrisks far outweigh the benefits‚Äô - for 100‚Äôs of 1000‚Äôs women!
Hope @BBCPanorama might consider a follow up investigation into pelvic #mesh now that New Zealand‚Äôs Medical regulators have today banned supply of mesh to their market. IMO, This is the latest step in a trend that will see Mesh use curtailed across the globe.
@BBCPanorama It‚Äôs the number revealed in Nature 2 months ago - it showed 9.8% of interventions resulting in adverse events. That is a minority. But a very significant one - and a level of risk that would not be seen as acceptable with many interventions. As NZ clearly agrees, thus their ban.
NZ Health Minister, Julie-Anne Genter, says:  ‚ÄúThis is an important step to preventing more women from being put in the potentially harmful situation too many New Zealand women have already experienced.‚Äù UK Ministers need to show similar leadership!
New Zealand has told companies that they are not allowed to supply surgical mesh for ANY pelvic operations (prolapse AND incontinence) from 2018 because ‚Äòrisks in SUI and prolapse far outweigh benefits‚Äô - NZ Health Ministry Spokes. UK should follow suit.
BREAKING: Hugely significant -New Zealand today becomes the first country to effectively ban supply of surgical mesh for ALL operations apart from Hernia repair. https://t.co/vEjljkMKKZ
Welcome that @BBCPanorama covered  #Mesh - but a shame they didnt make more effort to grasp the scale of the problem. 1 in 10 women suffering due to the operation is not a ‚Äòminority issue‚Äô, it‚Äôs a medical scandal. https://t.co/WTrnAaG2T0
It might be better for us all if he were and he did though...https://t.co/tlF7rcLfxp
Good to see @WalesOnline also covering the #mesh scandal this morning. Welsh Government ‚Äòreviewing use of TVT Mesh and awaiting NICE recommendations‚Äô. Another reason NICE need to speed up! https://t.co/VS3G9qZlRm
Important @BBCPanorama Special tonight on #mesh scandal. Policy makers need to watch this and suspend mesh use in the UK. https://t.co/9Yb12AgjdW
David Davis‚Äô glib statement that the agreement on Northern Ireland isn‚Äôt legally enforceable is another blow to the UK‚Äôs international standing as a trustworthy nation. Brexit is doing such damage to our reputation.

@DaphneLetterman No, it only refers to people born in NI.
Paragraph 50, guaranteeing that there will be no separation between GB and NI (subject to principle of consent, of course) is also very welcome and important - and a significant change since Monday.
Also hugely important that the new agreement confirms that NI Citizens will retain right to hold an Irish passport, as well as a UK one - and thus retain rights as EU citizens, to live and work across the EU.
Paragraph 49 is critical. A guarantee that there willl be no hard border in Ireland - preferably through UK wide ‚Äòalignment‚Äô with CU and SM, but if not for NI alone. Govt will now need to explain what they mean by ‚Äòfull alignment‚Äô. https://t.co/3WWzadkiiG
Good news that we are now to move to stage 2 - and good news that Govt seems to want alignment with CU and SM for whole UK as the way to avoid a hard border - with specific NI alignment a guaranteed fallback. https://t.co/lhXV0A5Pij
Massive disappointment, after a great bid. It‚Äôs still a fabulous ‚Äòugly, lovely‚Äô city of culture though... https://t.co/aNodPOR63j
The regulations which allow #Mesh devices onto the market are deeply flawed - as this new research shows. #slingthemesh https://t.co/YY0gcKzd7c
It will be a profound mistake by the Government to vote against Lady Hermon‚Äôs amendment. They should take every opportunity to underline their support for the Belfast Agreement.
Quite extraordinary that the Government seem set to reject Lady Hermon‚Äôs amendment protecting the Good Friday Agreement on the face of the Withdrawal Bill.
Labour takes great pride in the role we played in the Good Friday Agreement and I am proud again today to hear @JennyChapman powerfully express our determination to protect it. We need to hear the same from the Tories.
Labour‚Äôs Amendment 338 would guarantee that NO Government was able to undermine the GFA after Brexit - but Lady Hermon‚Äôs amendment clearly has support across the House and the Govt must surely accept it?
The Government must listen to cross party support for Lady Hermon‚Äôs amendment, and protect the Good Friday Agreement. Labour will certainly be supporting it.
Lady Sylvia Hermon giving an excellent speech, explaining with passion and knowledge, the importance of The Good Friday Agreement &amp; the need to protect it and guarantee an open, invisible border in Ireland.
Can it really be true as @bbcradioulster told me earlier, that Theresa May has asked for a meeting today with Arlene Foster only to be told Mrs. Foster is busy? Who is running this Government?
@bbcnickrobinson @BBCr4today Feel free to call me direct next time, Nick!
What a weak and confused response by David Davis to our questions about yesterday‚Äôs utter shambles. The UK‚Äôs reputation is falling fast thanks to these Tories.
@ian_mclaughlin @Keir_Starmer They only had to ask - I was on other stations...
Very interesting piece here by Fintan O‚ÄôToole. This Tory Brexit is damaging Britain at home and abroad https://t.co/3E1w0JlMJ2
@bbcnickrobinson @BBCr4today Not sure that‚Äôs true Nick, no-one asked me not to appear - you just didn‚Äôt ask.
The PM has been hapless dealing with Northern Ireland for the last year - now she is compounding problems with her shambolic Brexit manoeuvres.
@AdamBienkov The political equivalent of putting your fingers in your ears while singing loudly, la, la, la. And about as effective.
Rumours at Westminster that the PM is now to cancel a planned statement tomorrow on today‚Äôs debacle. She should come Parliament to explain to the people of Northern Ireland how she now plans to avoid a hard border.
And what a way to treat our neighbours and co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement: the Irish PM was told a deal was done and was ready to make a statement to that effect.
Clear from the Taoiseach‚Äôs statement that the PM fully intended to announce a deal on the border today - only to have her friends in the DUP pull the rug.
So the Tory Brexit pantomime rolls on, leaving people and businesses in Northern Ireland without any certainty about their future.
Government handling of the Irish Border issue today is utterly chaotic. People in Northern Ireland are being let down.
If true, this is good news. Hopefully it means Theresa May has recognised it was foolish to take Customs Union and Single Market off the table.  https://t.co/TxpRGQSt6a
18 months after Brexit vote... https://t.co/u3YOD2X19c
Hard Brexiteer, Owen Patterson on @BBCr4today - seemingly reasonable, but ultimately reckless with the security and prosperity of Northern Ireland.
The Tories need to explain this. https://t.co/aJI8mbF0ur
Either an interesting admission that staying in the Customs Union is the best way to avoid a hard Border in Ireland - or more evidence that the Govt. is utterly clueless on Brexit! https://t.co/rJfCBPtS0c
Lowest productivity since 1812. Greatest fall in living standards in 60 years. A lost decade for wages. Inflation rising. Brexit bleeding us dry. Don't ever tell me again the Tories are 'competent' with our economy.
Chancellor forced to squirrel away another ¬£3BILLION to guard against costs of Brexit. Don't remember seeing that on the bus.
BIG downgrades in GDP growth across the next 5 years. Both this year AND at end of the cycle - driving slower deficit reduction. Austerity had comprehensively failed.
And highlights the fact that 17 months after Brexit the Tories still  have no serious idea how to avoid a hard border in Ireland. https://t.co/oKdoB36sDo

Looking forward to appearing on @BBCNolan after 9 to discuss Tories' rotten rape clause. Wonder if Tory Ministers will come on to defend it?
The Tories are just making matters worse for women and professionals in NI with this deceitful defence of their appalling rape clause (4/4).
It says no rape victims have been prosecuted in NI - but it is an offence to breach Crim Law Act '67, as they will due to rape clause! (3/4)
.@NorwichChloe told Commons that women applying under the rape clause do not risk prosecution. Her written statement doesn't say that (2/4).
The Tories snuck out a statement last night on the NI rape clause. You can read its dissembling contents here(1/4): https://t.co/eeVUYeG9ta
Looks as though Sec of State for NI is having to correct the record after his Minister's misleading comments on the appalling 'rape-clause': https://t.co/Nr33pDAccp
@DaveRJ_Elliott I agree
@Murfohomo @ClaireSugden Not true. Aviva, Croke, Thomond, Kingspan, Windsor Park, Semple, Musgrave, Galway...
@ian_mclaughlin No, fully aware of bid, similar to that successfully made by Wales prior to 1999. And there's always the Aviva, Croke, Thomond, Ravenhill...
I wrote to Barra McGrory asking him to guarantee that rape victims would not be liable to prosecution under the Universal Credit rape clause. He confirmed that he cannot guarantee that- a fact flatly denied by Ministers today. They need to explain themselves. https://t.co/9uSNHX73PM
This World Cup should have been held Ireland, which despite great stadia, passion and rugby tradition -North and South- has yet to host it! https://t.co/J2idFO70P7
The Minister must urgently clarify her misleading answer on the rape clause. The NI Director of Public Prosecutions says women who seek exemption from the Universal Credit two-child limit on grounds of rape are 'potentially liable to prosecution.' https://t.co/SJ2v3MKeQl
Shameful, deeply misleading answer from the Tories on the rape clause in NI. The NI DPP says women are 'potentially liable to prosecution.'
@KeithKeith80 You, however, are clearly totally charming.

Excellent @jeremycorbyn support for #Bombardier in #PMQs after today's powerful lobby of Parliament by  @unitetheunion Bombardier workers. https://t.co/RE4l7veH88
Extraordinary that the PM cannot even commit to making the Universal Credit helpline free for those being hit by the UC shambles! #PMQs
Excellent to see our local council recognised for leading our community in support of the Armed Forces. https://t.co/pzBHssAtXl
@EmmaHardyMP @MeshCampaign Great work giving voice to #mesh injured women and securing the debate. Thanks on behalf of all the campaigners on this scandal!
Rhetorical support of Tory Ministers for #Bombardier is welcome but we need action i.e. clarity on consequences for #Boeing if they persist.
More good news: LABOUR's @EmmaHardyMP has secured our debate in Parly on Risk of #Mesh Implants. Next Weds at 0930am in Westminster Hall https://t.co/iFeQXpnHPW
Great question from @karinsmyth in the Commons - demanding that the voices of #mesh injured women are heard by ministers and the NHS.
@JoyJoyjones271 I voted against Article 50 and the Withdrawal Bill.
And very interesting to hear Tory Minister tell Parliament that the new NICE guidance on #Mesh for SUI is being brought forward to next year
Excellent news: @SharonHodgsonMP has just announced that @UKLabour policy is now to call for a Public Enquiry into #Mesh #slingthemesh
@2Scooppy With 4000 directly employed and more than 20,000 indirectly supported jobs here in the U.K.
The Prime Minister is flying to Washington tomorrow to urge Trump to stop attacking #Bombardier. Trouble is it's the Canadian PM, not ours.
@Is_Me_Ben Thanks
3. And has this disabused Tories of their fantasy that we will secure and easy free trade agreement with the USA after Brexit??
2. What exactly has Govt. said to Boeing? We spend ¬£1.5Bn a yr with Boeing. Have we said this'll impact on orders &amp; hit their bottom line?
Lots of Qs Bombardier workers need Ans. to today: 1. What exactly did the PM say to Pres. Trump? Did she ask him to ask Boeing to withdraw?
Well played Republic of Ireland! #takemehome üôÅ
With all respect to fans and citizens of the Republic in Northern Ireland, COME ON WALES!
Customs White Paper includes a bit ostensibly on contingency arrangements for the Irish Border if no deal...but doesn't say what they are!! https://t.co/AkjPUO8T5l
The only point of that statement seems to have been for PM to hint a little harder at her readiness for a disastrous 'No Deal'. Depressing.
Hope there's something of note in the White Papers Govt are to publish, as this statement by the PM is devoid of detail or proof of progress
Good news: Gov't finally set to make a statement on #Bombardier tomorrow. They must support #Belfast workers and ask Boeing to withdraw
@MikeBrown__ @rugbyPhilBB @rnash520 @Cardiff_RFC @PontypriddRFC But none of it spoiled another excellent  day at the Arms Park. We wish we could play you there every week! Ol√©
@MikeBrown__ @rugbyPhilBB @rnash520 @Cardiff_RFC @PontypriddRFC Something similar happened last year. Then because there were too few staff at the bottom gate, yesterday because that gate had no tickets.
@MikeBrown__ @rugbyPhilBB @rnash520 @Cardiff_RFC @PontypriddRFC A final response. I sent a tweet at 1429, from the queue of a few hundred on Westgate St. We missed the first try. Those are the facts. 1/2
@MikeBrown__ @Cardiff_RFC @PontypriddRFC Thanks. But no it wasn't. I was in a queue outside after kick-off. The same thing happened last year. Why only one entrance this year?
@MikeBrown__ @Cardiff_RFC @PontypriddRFC Mike, I was in a queue out of the ground as the game kicked off. Hundreds missed first Cardiff try. Still, all's well that ends well. Ol√©
Another great win for @PontypriddRFC at the Arms Park! #COTP #Ol√©
Typical shambles @Cardiff_RFC - hundreds of fans queuing outside the ground (again) with too few people on the gate. Come on @PontypriddRFC
@thecardiffarms Yes, well we could do with a Government that in the face of America First doesn't just rollover and put Belfast &amp; British manufacturing last
And make no mistake, Boeing are pushing the envelope for Trump's aggressive protectionism. After Bombardier, who's next?
Bombardier should win their ITC appeal but US Commerce Dept's imposition of a 300%(!) tariff, risking 4K NI jobs, is a scandalous abuse.
Boeing's attempt to crush Bombardier is being backed to the hilt by Trump. This is what he meant by America First. https://t.co/aMlzrxw7aq
Looking forward to attending. https://t.co/R76jZgacqr
Have to say this still feels to me like an enormous missed opportunity to do something transformative in the Valleys https://t.co/D0AO2aLim7

@MMorgan1958 @SWPTaff @YourPontypridd @PontyTC The police have just assigned a second full time officer to duty in the town centre in addition to the PCSOS. We also have a new Inspector.
@MMorgan1958 @SWPTaff @YourPontypridd @PontyTC If true, have you reported them?
At Pontypridd Museum this evening at 5pm, @SWPTaff Chief Super is meeting residents and me to discuss policing in Ponty. All welcome.
Excellent discussion this morning with Trades Union colleagues from @NIC_ICTU - united in our support of #Bombardier workers. https://t.co/8ya1e1wcpm
Hooray! I was worried Terrace Talk had gone forever! How was I supposed to make it through those long afternoons on the green benches! https://t.co/77Z25akMib

Excellent news. Especiallly pleased with plans for Trehafod and Pontyclun, where we desperately need more capacity: Trains and car spaces. https://t.co/hIgadN1So2
Looking forward to visiting #Bombardier again today and hearing latest from staff, Unions and Management. Labour supports Bombardier.
After a week attacking Labour faith in State power to fix broken markets, PM's policy rabbit is a plan for more council houses! #comedygold
Irish Ministers grasp the gravity of the #Bombardier situation: loss of 4000 NI jobs would hurt prosperity and peace https://t.co/RgrCqPIyLU
Another crucial 24hrs for #Bombardier before further rulings in #Boeing dispute. PM should use her speech today to urge Trump to intervene.
Very pleased to see such intervention. It's illegal to drink in the park and along Taff Street. https://t.co/UwgkLrX6EI

Would the EU have been fighting harder to support #Bombardier jobs in NI before Brexit. You know the answer. https://t.co/no5B9eopL2
Fantasy that Brexit will benefit UK trade with the US - or other major economies - is exposed by #Bombardier crisis https://t.co/BhjS7vu59T
Might explain why Whitehall has been taking #Boeing side instead of standing up for #Bombardier workers in Northern Ireland #backBombardier https://t.co/tuc8adFEUz
Disappointing that @JBrokenshire spoke for so long on #tw2 but said so little. People in NI need certainty about the post-Brexit border!
Powerful evidence that the number of women injured by #Mesh is far greater than the NHS has admitted. https://t.co/p3DzyGNuOz
@IainDale @PickardJE Ask him what the PM said to Pres. Trump about Bombardier - and what he replied. Also why Whitehall was  initially siding with Boeing?!
@SWPTaff @PontyTC @YourPontypridd @RCTCouncil Good to see such visible patrolling in recent weeks. Thanks!
Thanks to all @FardreCC for allowing me to share another cracking awards ceremony. Great company and top-notch sledging! https://t.co/xeMivamGTq
Yet more evidence emerges of the #mesh scandal that's blighted so many women's lives. Mesh use should be suspended until risk is fully known https://t.co/QCmLGaDECS

Looking forward to working with our new Police Inspector, Hannah Durham, on plans to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour in #Pontypridd https://t.co/3JSqMQ8eWI
Good to see PM has woken from her snooze &amp; spotted the risk to #Bombardier Shame she didn't speak out against Boeing with Trudeau last week!
It is truly disgraceful that the Tories waited until #Bombardier lost the case before they suggested they might cancel #Boeing contracts!
The Bombardier crisis also shows why we need an executive back in Belfast. The Tories can't be relied on to stand up for Northern Ireland.
Why did Theresa May refuse to echo Justin Trudeau's promise to cuts contracts with #Boeing if they pursued action against #Bombardier ?
And try telling Bombardier workers this morning that post Brexit we'll be striking 'easy' free trade agreements with the US!
UK officials told journalists last week that they were 'quietly confident' Boeing would lose the #Bombardier case. Complacency costs jobs.
Mrs May &amp; the Tories have been criminally negligent in failing to force withdrawal of this action by Boeing https://t.co/OcRaBCwbAB?ssr=true
Excellent to see this from the Irish Government. Hopefully a sign of change across the whole of Ireland https://t.co/XnYZv2q1Uq?ssr=true
Hear! Hear! Lovely to see them both tonight! https://t.co/O81DbXqqVv
@2mircol She'd have to go to Northern Ireland to do that though....
I was hoping the PM might explain how she intends to square this circle. So were the people of Northern Ireland. https://t.co/ihn5vETfoy
Disappointing and irresponsible of the PM to say nothing new about how she believes the Irish Border issue can be resolved. #Brexit
Deeply disappointing. Though entirely predictable. https://t.co/C1YdzIF7kg
Wonderful to see @YPantSchool officially open. Thanks @fmwales for doing the honours &amp; to the fabulous ukulele band for the entertainment! https://t.co/jCxGWCDdAx
Canada will cancel Boeing contracts unless they lift threat to Bombardier-Why is PM not fighting harder for UK jobs? https://t.co/1FBpki405a

@GarySpedding @AmnestyNI My pleasure.
Labour agrees wholeheartedly that Brexit cannot jeopardise the rights secured through the GFA and underpinned by the EU. https://t.co/pETPcOGTvV
@retail_ni @HospUlster @ManufacturingNI Great to hear a united voice from business in NI: they want the Executive up &amp; running and they want certainty on what Brexit means for NI.
Disappointing that SOSNI refused to provide clarity on the post-Brexit Irish border. Only a Customs Union preserves prosperity &amp; security.
@SharonHodgsonMP Great news! You are very welcome!
Congrats to @NicholaMallon on election as @SDLPlive Deputy Leader. Looking forward to working with you to restore power-sharing in NI.

@pontyclunath @YPantSchool @WelshAthletics @sebcoe @AndrewMorganRCT Hi my office has been liaising with Roland at the club throughout- we're awaiting a meeting date from RCT &amp;will be in touch again to confirm
@NIBusiness I have never heard that said by business in Wales.
15 months after the Brexit vote &amp; the EU has to remind the Tories of their responsibility to solve the border issue and protect the GFA... https://t.co/TMr8JMXoky
Any solution to the Irish border issue must protect GFA at all costs. EU is right call for concrete commitments - not more waffle - from HMG
Excellent work by @Carl4AandD - speaking up for Mesh injured women! https://t.co/VY6fZkjsuB

@GlamBrewingCo I can vouch for their excellence!
NHS England #mesh report is a missed opportunity. We need to know how many women have been injured in the past, as well as preventing more.

@gildernewm @irish_news In light of the what PSNI describe as a 'model' 12th, we now need to see Unionist leadership to address the bonfires too.
@gildernewm Hi Michelle, I'll take you up on that. I've just condemned the Dungannon and Sandy Row fires specifically in an Int. with @irish_news 1/2
@BrianFrancisRoy I did so yesterday, Brian. On TV and radio.
@kevak1969 I condemn it unreservedly - as I have on TV and radio. I also condemn placing effigies and images of nationalist politicians on bonfires.
Thanks to all across Belfast who welcomed me to the 12th celebrations yesterday. Well done to all who helped events pass off so peacefully.
@gina_knows I agree. Next week's lobby of Parliament will be a step on that road.
@chris_roarty It's a collectors item! Proof that I was the future once...

@gabundy Just knocked, I mean - not knocked in!
@gabundy I knocked you door in yesterday Gareth. Got no time for grudges, comrade.
@Matt83taylor @jeremycorbyn Completely agree. The cuts to the service have left it teetering on the brink of disaster.
@carolynharris24 Great to be invited to speak at the rally today - and inspiring that so many #waspi  women turned up to campaign alongside us.
@CardiffCityMBC @Pontyclun Hi Jon, not sure which photo you mean. We were out in Pontyclun last Saturday and are again next week. I'll make sure we let you know when.
That's great to hear! Thank you, David. https://t.co/b6hDxfcX3A
@kv654321 I'm doing that every day, Kevin, trying to get a Labour government elected!
A real privilege to address the fabulous #WASPI rally at the #senedd today. #Labour backing the Waspi women! https://t.co/N1b40Fxorz
@VictoriaJayne_7 I know you are called James, James! Dennis is my friend in the chair!
@AdrianDennis01 I didn't see that, Adrian. How much is the increase?
Many thanks to everyone who took time to talk to us in #Beddau and #Tynant today, especially Dennis and Penelope! https://t.co/HGmarX2KqB
I'll be there Celia! Wouldn't miss it. https://t.co/UA918QyrFZ
Great to see you too. Thanks for the support! https://t.co/Xq7K4hKV2C
@SerenCoch @WelshLabour Diolch!
RCT will be holding a vigil tonight at the Fountain on Taff Street, Pontypridd, at 6pm, in support of all affected by the #Manchester bomb
Terrible, heartbreaking news from Manchester. Our family's thoughts are with all those affected by this monstrous act.
It emerges that the #DementiaTax is Mrs May's own pet project - what did she say about them being 'the Nasty Party'? https://t.co/wPTeeogrSg
For those who say 'there's no point voting, they're all the same': Wales won't have #dementiatax under #welshlabour https://t.co/qulNfzzx1g
So, Thatcher allowed people to buy their council houses. May says she'll have them back now...
Those saying Mayism' is a return to 'one nation' Toryism must have missed her plans to seize pensioners' homes and scrap school dinners, no?
@SJRichards79 Lol
@AndrewGronow @WelshLabour Good to meet you too.
@SJRichards79 Brown. Every time. Obvs.
Fantastic support for @WelshLabour today in #Pontypridd #Hopkinstown #Trehafod &amp; #Pwllgwaun #StandingUpForWales https://t.co/fcmms6cgNY
@MichaelDugher Phew...
@RhonddaBryant Oh. Boring.
@RhonddaBryant Are you winking at Ponty? Or is the sun shining on The Rhondda as usual?!!
@ryman99 @NevilleSouthall Nat debt was ¬£700bn when Labour left office (due to global banking crisis). It is ¬£1.8 Trillion today. Tories doubled the  debt for our kids
This is a scandalous, anti-democratic abuse of power. Designed to deny the vote to people unlikely to support Tories https://t.co/ZBDpxcI5o2
A vote for May means #Pontypridd pensioners get pensions cut, fuel allowance cut &amp; a tax on their home 4 social care https://t.co/p76Y7bnBTI
Terrible news tonight to learn of the death of Rhodri Morgan, a friend and mentor. He will be greatly missed. Love to Julie &amp; family.
I know I'm  late to this...but I can't resist. Must be my age! https://t.co/XABGGGKn4H
@heidi_mp @martinangus @WelshLabour All of them. Every single one. Just like in Lewisham!!!!
For sure! https://t.co/kKcmHRvVDh
Thanks to all who took time to talk to us in #Llantrisant Old Town tonight. I'm very grateful for all your support. https://t.co/kJAZBnfS9r
Good to see such strong support for @WelshLabour in #Tonyrefail today! https://t.co/f5zumbmAqb
And don't forget No. 10: The Tories have doubled the debt to ¬£1.8 Trillion, saddling us with years more austerity! https://t.co/ocJpIlcg77
@robvsnature Housing benefit. Now denied to all under 21.
@mikegoulden @robvsnature May's putting the con back into conservative.
@stevec009 @AMCarwyn @WelshLabour You mean the one the Welsh Labour Govt bought from the private sector and is now to be home to 1000 new public sector jobs? Yeah, should've.
10. And never forget: They DOUBLED the National Debt to ¬£1.8 Trillion, saddling future generations with years more cuts and hardship.
9. Destroyed opportunities for learning culture and leisure in so many communities through cuts to libraries, theatres, arts centres &amp; parks
8. They've denied 10s of 1000s access to justice in the workplace with punishing Tribunal Fees and the end of Legal Aid.
7. They slashed financial support for working class kids trying to go to Uni, or train as a nurse, or set up in their own home.
6. These Tories have cut % of public spending on the services we need - NHS, Social Care, Schools - to the lowest levels since the 1930s!
5. They demonised and vilified our proud Trades Unions - tried effectively to destroy them for good with their disgraceful Trade Union Bill.
4. They've done sweet FA to support struggling manufacturing, especially steel - while pretending there's a Tory industrial strategy!
3. They've 'delivered' the slowest growth in wages and the biggest increase in insecure work since records began.
2. Then they created something called a 'Work Allowance' under Universal Credit - before slashing it in half, costing families ¬£1000s.
The notion that the Tories is the party for working class people is laughable. Remember their record: 1. They destroyed vital Tax Credits...
No wonder the Tories are hoping you don't actually look at their record over the last seven years... https://t.co/acVO4aOzVi
@SusanGLH She learned all about us when she was Juliette4CynonValley in 2010!
@spencer555_p At least ours will be able to find Ponty - she had to pass through it when she stood in Cynon Valley a few years ago!
#Tonyrefail through the trees: great new view of Coedely and Ton beyond from top of Smaelog after forestry works https://t.co/dVVxV0MFCH
Massive congrats to all @RhydyfelinRFC for a fantastic season. Looking forward to seeing you in the Championship! https://t.co/NHrq592JkE
And the few Tory voters I could find in Pontyclun yesterday seemed a bit miffed too that their candidate was arriving by parachute!
I hear local Tories are fighting like rats in a sack at imposition of a PPC from London. Apparently she is Iain Duncan Smith's prot√©g√©e!
@AMCarwyn Ha! An almighty row among Ponty Tories too: none of them deemed up to the job by CCHQ, who've parachuted  in someone from the Home Counties!
Another strong, and popular policy:  https://t.co/cotmvqe9Jc
My pleasure. It was a great night. https://t.co/SKfIEvDJMb
Fantastic reception in #Pontyclun today on the #labourdoorstep - we picked up a few plants at the garden sale too!üåπ https://t.co/c3zgJBao7g
@judealdridge Great to meet you both too. Have a good weekend.
@tykelawyer Definitely
At the one and only Copper Kettle! Thanks for visiting. See you soon. https://t.co/hueYxD40Lw
@benjones159 Thanks Ben! See you at Sardis next year.
Definitely! I can't actually believe Theresa May wants to repeal it if she wins. New Leader, but same old Tories. https://t.co/DC35vUKdSD
Fantastic to welcome @tom_watson &amp; @AMCarwyn to #Pontypridd today. Shoppers were pleased @WelshLabour is #StandingUpForWales #GE2017 https://t.co/sCsBRq9ndl
Thanks to all we met on the #Graig &amp; in #LlantwitFadre today Especially to those flying their #WelshLabour colours! https://t.co/pZzD9UI0HS
Great to be on the #labourdoorstep again today in Tonyrefail and Llantrisant, lots asking for @WelshLabour boards! https://t.co/Rlbq51zH4n
@pontycyclops Pass my thanks on to your dad for his tips on my veg patch via @theJeremyVine
Thanks to residents in Beddau, Tynant &amp; Tonyrefail for chatting to us today on the #labourdoorstep. Lots of support for @WelshLabour #GE2017 https://t.co/BnAhQlOa3X
Thanks to everyone in the Fire Service for your brilliant work putting out the blaze on the Billy Wynt in #Llantrisant this morning.
Fantastic opening speech from our brilliant new Tonyrefail West Councillor @lexydavies at @WelshLabour's #GE2017 launch #StandingUpForWales https://t.co/C8PnN0SQ7U

@EvanstheAirwave @PontypriddRFC @RGCNews Hello comrade! Give me a ring when you are home sometime.
@IrregularShed @UniSouthWales And he was VERY good! Glad he's not standing against me!

@BenDylan @labourlewis ü§î
Congratulations to the tremendous @RCTlabour candidates who won their seats and thanks for the service to those who lost #standingupforwales https://t.co/bqmVsWMozs
Excellent results for @welshlabour  in #RCT Well done to all who worked so hard!
Very, very disappointed to hear news @brendantoomey1 has lost. You've been a truly outstanding servant for Labour and Merthyr, Brendan.
Congratulations! Great local company - and even better beer! https://t.co/6xVBBy6WBE
@loobey41 Yes. A central govt, objective portal for publishing pledges etc. and assessing manifestos is a v good idea.
@loobey41 Pontyclun Hub does that too. Though that's sort of what the election address that goes to each house does, no?
Good luck to the mighty @BronwenBrooks and all @VoGLabour today!
Good luck today to @AndrewMorganRCT who has done such an excellent job leading @RCTCouncil in recent years.
Deepest condolences to the family and friends of Luke Hole and all @PontyclunRfc
@prixpics In my dreams...
It was a pleasure - especially the excellent grilling by Jason! https://t.co/V2vhjPRshq
Also best of luck tomorrow to @jaynebrencher @SteveCarterRCT @ricky2503 and all our other brilliant @RCTlabour candidates! #ambitious4RCT

Great to be out talking to residents in Tonyrefail today, lots telling us they're voting for Labour's @lexydavies tomorrow! #labourdoorstep https://t.co/1Tw2Bw4rhP

...and again on the Pension Triple lock: PM can't look her interviewer in the eye as she answers. Don't recommend she take up playing poker!
Slippery answers on Tax from the PM on #Marr She can't look him in the eye when she's fibbing!
PM says 'there are many complex reasons why people go to food banks.' Um, not really. It's mainly because they can't afford to eat.

Important pledge by @UKLabour today - to end the pay cap on overworked and undervalued NHS staff https://t.co/1962PG4ytP?ssr=true
@cyprus364 Mmm. History would suggest otherwise. The last Labour Govt cut VAT to 15%. Every Tory Govt since 1974 has put it up.
@JohnWel33979172 We didn't raise income tax for the whole 13 years of the last Labour govt. We cut VAT to 15% and CT to lowest in EU. No perhaps about that.
The spike in Food Bank usage is a direct effect of the Tories' chaotic Universal Credit system for people in work! https://t.co/czJ9bXnk12
Get ready for another increase in VAT if Theresa May wins the election. They always put up VAT when they win.  https://t.co/6MN5qgBQvK
The fruits of Mrs May's 'strong leadership': more working people using food banks than ever before. https://t.co/9buSZ0WViv
