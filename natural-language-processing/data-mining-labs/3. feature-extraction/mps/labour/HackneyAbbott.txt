Govt are not even aiming to reach a new Security Treaty. Without that, many of the tools the police and security services use daily will be severely compromised. 2/4

https://t.co/epexhP4jAR
Tory Cabinet finally admits we need migrant workers.  But can't resist playing worn-out dog whistle about 'clampdowns'.
Tory nonsense on “high-skilled” or “low-skilled”. It’s really high-paid and low-paid. To say that everyone who earns below £50k is “low-skilled” is an insult to the hard-working people of Britain.
May is making a dubious distinction between “high” and “low” skill. Social care workers technically “low” skill. But they are vital to our society https://t.co/oDmtabaXoG

This Government have left the Home office in disarray.  The Tories need to get a grip and end this chaos now https://t.co/GRXSbl1NTs
This is too little too late from the Tories after scraping the agricultural workers scheme.  Many farmers have been dealing with labour shortages  https://t.co/1JHAoHfvII
It’s time for the Govt to end the hostile environment for good. Unless and until they do, the reek of the Windrush scandal will forever be associated with this rotten Government.  My latest article  ↓  https://t.co/tSb0RNkCXT
Speaking at the @fbunational Report launch into the #Grenfell tower fire. It wasn't the firefighters that let people down, it was the Government. https://t.co/scPrMKyFIw
With just six weeks until Brexit talks were supposed to conclude, the Tories have no Brexit plan and no support in Parliament for the Chequers proposal.  A "no deal" Brexit would be a catastrophe. #PMQs https://t.co/mU7kjXPRE6
We have Ministers telling us they are sorting out the Windrush scandal, and that their hostile environment isn’t to blame. But this shows their reassurances are worthless https://t.co/Dw8xhlWKU9
It is clear that the #Windrush scandal and the continuing horrors that are being revealed as part of it, are entirely due to the Government’s hostile environment policy https://t.co/GwbT9gqM5M
This is an absolute scandal. If these rates of pay were anywhere other than in immigration detention centres they would fall into the category of modern slavery https://t.co/pTkoBhGXFK
Before the Coalition in 2010 the Met had 33,367 officers. The Chancellor, aka George Osborne slashed police funding.  Met officers are down to 30,871 in 2017. Osborne and the Tories have never understood #Cutshaveconsequences https://t.co/9BjVAPF0pU
The large scale of immigration appeals being lost by the Home Office is a scandal. Until the Government drops this hostile environment policy entirely, further scandals like this are sure to emerge https://t.co/56Bw9TDbYj
The scale of this threat to children is staggering. It is evident that the Government has simply not treated these appalling crimes with the seriousness they deserve https://t.co/ZC93KIbaCb

A strong coordinated response is needed, but this Tory government has cut budgets to Border Force staff and axed 21,000 police officers. They are the front line in the fight against modern slavery https://t.co/b7alWmfwjp

An apology does not go far enough. Citizens have been denied benefits, deported, detained, made to sign non-exclusive agreements and refused a hardship fund, whilst the compensation scheme is delayed.  We must do better by the #Windrush gen affected by the Tories hostile policies https://t.co/pL7mRjysna
This official apology is too late and doesn't go far enough. The Home Secretary has failed to confirm when the compensation scheme will be up and running after citizens have been left destitute, in debt and jobless by the Govt’s hostile environment.  https://t.co/srYQ9BD1jS

This is inhumane treatment from the Home Office. Families should not be separated and Sajid Javid should instruct officials to address this case fairly and as a matter of urgency https://t.co/qwSy7vgq7u
The Government is not fulfilling its promise to deal with these cases quickly. The Tories are still letting the #Windrush generation down https://t.co/dW6hSJvuAQ
The Tories need to stand up to Serco’s determination to put profit before people. It is appalling that so many vulnerable asylum seekers who have fled conflict across the world are being treated in this way. https://t.co/ZK468DMAV7

This scandal over gagging orders follows the Home Secretary's refusal to make interim hardship payments to #Windrush scandal victims. The Home Office still has not revealed how many people have been affected.  My article for @Independent  https://t.co/g8DgPClRJD
Responding to a Home Office question on the 16th July 2018 Sajid Javid said: "No one will be asked to sign any kind of non-disclosure agreement or anything like that". So how do you explain this? https://t.co/fR1WJJ8bt1
Tory cuts are leaving communities exposed. More than 21,000 police officers have been axed and recorded crime is rising at the fastest rate in a decade https://t.co/d7wHxp7Spw
The #Windrush generation has been failed time and time again by this government. The Home Secretary promised to ‘do right’ by our fellow citizens from the Windrush generation yet it appears he has gone back on his word https://t.co/ddtb9IEaUu

#Grenfell Inquiry enters second week of powerful and touching testimonials of those who died in the fire, given by their loved ones. Absolutely correct that the inquiry has given prominence to those who lost their lives.  https://t.co/h34v9KhYM9
In 2008, I tried to extend abortion rights to Northern Ireland. This time it’s different https://t.co/NeY6hUtvDt
In 2008 I tabled an amendment to human fertilisation &amp; embryology bill. Amendment would have finally extended 1967 Abortion Act to Northern Ireland. Government blocked it. Better luck this time?   https://t.co/LBGmDa3Fui

Almost admitting what Tories have so far refused - that their cuts have consequences on crime. Almost. https://t.co/vBbOYBwi5b
At #PMQs Theresa May says 'continuing to look at situation' where doctors are barred from taking up NHS jobs here because of her hostile environment. Meanwhile, patients suffer while she 'looks'.

Knee-jerk reactions and initiatives designed to grab a headline are not acceptable. The Govt must apply lessons learned from other parts of the UK and abroad in the fight against violent crime #SaferCommunities https://t.co/eo07LlGbt7
The people of Manchester didn’t allow the bombing to tear them apart, they showed outstanding love, solidarity and strength. #WeStandTogether 🐝 https://t.co/wwLOQHatbp
So #YarlsWood staff tried to stop me talking to inmates. But it was a highly publicised visit. So the inmates literally jammed the corridor &amp; staff forced to allow a proper meeting https://t.co/BOv3a00eOv
This is a scandal. Theresa May said she was offering "a fixed a deadline of three weeks for everybody affected to be found a home nearby". https://t.co/Of9FvHDwth
Police cuts have consequences https://t.co/ETtm8IiKKF

Claudia will be an excellent MP https://t.co/khTmXCGH3A
@toryboypierce Actually I have said neither #justsaying
Great to see @ClaudiaWebbe pledge to fight for a better deal for workers in Lewisham, for the repeal of the trade union act &amp; to always stand shoulder to shoulder with those taking action. She first joined a union aged 16 as a youth worker &amp; has campaigned with unions ever since. https://t.co/ZSb9xNzbeu

Typical. My speech was mainly on tackling Windrush scandal. But Mail talks about illegal immigration. Once again, Windrush generation aren't illegal immigrants. https://t.co/5eThN3SCMC

I'm sure she'll stand up for Lewisham East’s proud, diverse communities, &amp; be a fierce advocate for equality. https://t.co/QYy1PEucYB
What has happened to the #Windrush generation is a scandal. The Government must ensure they are protected from the threat of deportation #EndHostileEnvironment #IPPRAbbott https://t.co/MzNIOI7eR1
Labour’s Manifesto already included a pledge to hire 500 extra Border Guards to help tackle illegal immigration. The Tories cut the number of Border Guards #EndHostileEnvironment  #IPPRAbbott https://t.co/0Sprp8WwTm
Labour will end indefinite immigration detention. It will return to the promised 28-day limit in deportation cases #EndHostileEnvironment #IPPRAbbott https://t.co/EDPclA2RQK
This Govt has long had an obsession with enriching the private sector from the public purse, despite soaring costs, shoddy service and human misery. Labour will end this rotten system. Private firms have no business in detention. #EndHostileEnvironment #IPPRAbbott https://t.co/QJjnETia6C

This govt is turning away doctors, scientists, engineers and students under their ridiculous cap on Tier 2 visas for skilled workers. They enrich us all in so many ways. Labour will be encouraging International Students. Not barring them. #EndHostileEnvironment #IPPRAbbott https://t.co/ODmlUL0hXN
People are kept in detention for months, even years, Including #Windrush gen, refugees, victims of torture and sexual violence. #YarlsWood has caused much pain to vulnerable women we should've been protecting. Diverting resources here is the right thing to do.#IPPRAbbott https://t.co/gdwcpOGJ13
More agreement with @KwasiKwarteng He has just said correctly that the Tories need to beware of looking slow, grudging and reluctant in helping the survivors #GrenfellDebate https://t.co/W8EfZxRwYc
Rarely agree with @KwasiKwarteng but in #GrenfellDebate he has just correctly told his fellow Tories that residents of North Kensington increasingly felt left behind &amp; Tories will be judged by how they deal with #Grenfell https://t.co/3QIZIAZ3VW
Great speech by @emmadentcoad on Grenfell. She makes the important point that things are moving so slowly that “Some Grenfell survivors will not make it” @GrenfellUnited #GrenfellDebate https://t.co/4ohSYEHCe2

@CalumSPlath Sending you a big hug
Theresa May claimed as far as she was "aware" none of the #Windrush generation had been deported but the Home Secretary has told us today that 63 people "could have" been deported, how does the Government not know whether it has deported its own citizens? https://t.co/aP0KCgJSok

Imagine living in a country that wrongly deports its own citizens. Under Theresa May's hostile environment you don't have to imagine.
How many bank accounts wongly closed under Tory 'hostile environment'? https://t.co/0ayGtLMa2j
Sajid Javid says 'hostile environment' is negative and 'unBritish'. He doesn't need to convince the rest of us. Needs to tell Theresa May.
Windrush row: 63 people could have been wrongly removed, says Javid https://t.co/hMpmiBXUYT Govt previously could find no-one wrongfully deported. Still not answering on numbers detained, or refused re-entry, or 'voluntary removals' after threats of deportation.
Capita staff used ‘excessive’ restraint on asylum seekers https://t.co/6c9NU7frBc Unacceptable. Excessive force used on low-risk detainees.
