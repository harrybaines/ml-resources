@LTHlondon britain is better than that diatribe - truly. Now please do not contact me again. thanks.
For the love of god @BTGroup why hasn't this been sorted out? Please don't tell me you haven't got the wherewithall to get this fixed without the need for me to have to keep chasing you as already have done several times?! One for you perhaps @theJeremyVine ?! #couldntmakeitup! https://t.co/db2vR0bTl5
Yes ‚Ä¶er‚Ä¶just to be clear when i said I was speaking out against the weight of opinion, didn‚Äôt mean my own kilograms there ‚Ä¶.. https://t.co/ECAsvUmeL2
Agree @GarethQuinn80 and respect and try to read people disagreeing with me as makes me think and reflect. Do think a stream of invective and suggestions my family should be blown up or I am a terrorist sympathiser for expressing concern at any action of the home sec a bit OTT.. https://t.co/beMtfacLse
We owe the victims a proper trial for her role in all of this and full accountability. We also owe it to ourselves to speak up when Home Sec seeks to evade accountability for consequences of his actions. Shout as much as you want, I'm not going to be silent on protecting rights. https://t.co/0qyS8GgSEb

Heh! Most constructive and challenging thing I have read on twitter this evening. I mean what about toads? Or lizards? given so many of his poems about nature how did he manage out in the countryside?! See who says social media not thought provoking anymore‚Ä¶ https://t.co/o6ikck0EGW
Since when did standing up to a Home Secretary acting ultra vires become unbritish? Or do you just wear a flag as an affectation for twitter rather than defend its worth? You want real British grit -speak out before the state decides law can be rewritten unilaterally not after.. https://t.co/oqtKxNKUBr
FWIW as Creasy also a hugenot surname it‚Äôs probably the only thing I share with Nigel farage‚Ä¶both our families at some point sought refuge from persecution and looked to Britain to be a beacon- not a breaker- of human rights principles‚Ä¶those lessons of history ey‚Ä¶ü§®üôÉ https://t.co/0Cno8aaPbe
Have been very clear in view she should face full force of British justice system. One that shouldn‚Äôt be rode roughshod over by a Home Secretary chancing rules on citizenship‚Ä¶ https://t.co/6IpEPfN1Cu
This is true - appears she has dual citizenship by descent and not directly. Home Secretary appears to be trying to create precedent - if that passes without challenge it offers a template for state action that should trouble all who defend British values‚Ä¶even on social media.. https://t.co/oiY7pXaO17
It means you can abhor everything Isis stand for and also stand up to a Home Secretary who is acting unilaterally to rewrite citizenship rights because without scrutiny history teaches us such behaviour never ends well‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not an either or‚Ä¶ https://t.co/szt3miqkww
@Patsyblueshoes perhaps patsy you could not tweet me again if all you want to send is abusive and offensive messages? I'm not going to dignify such hate with a response certainly.

Thanks John- definitely think your ability to call me a ponce is one of the values and principles we must fight for, along with the right of citizens to challenge the state and compassion for those fleeing persecution from regimes like ISIS. Look forward to your work on all ... https://t.co/mlIcPO3s3c
@geoffdeanexxx its a he, and its a week old. There's a really strong safeguarding argument to remove that child from that environment. That isn't the one you're making.
Thanks @tegsy_vw for thus proving that creating a process whereby a British citizen can have their citizenship revoked with little scrutiny inevitably to a wish list approach.... https://t.co/j7YMCXceEy
@geoffdeanexxx yep seriously. Everything she supported is abhorrent and she should be held accountable for it.  So too citizenship isn't something to be taken away without scrutiny as where does that end? also interested you apparently know the future behaviour of a week old child?
"Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power." As orwell spotted of those who seek to twist the values of our proud nation, you sir are no patriot... https://t.co/S1YchFz5Nw

@Archimbaldo @banebutwoke Hi Archie you are of course entitled to your opinion, and please don‚Äôt spam my timeline with it given it makes it harder for me to use twitter to keep up with Walthamstow. Thanks.
@MattJCreasey_ @ofthesparrows @Tom_Gann @banebutwoke @ZinnTruther I picked up on this because someone challenged me on it. It is not doxing to use a name someone has put in the public domain. I use real names Matt because we are real people behind these accounts. I note you disagree. I consider this matter to be at an end - thanks.
@mickybooble @banebutwoke This is news to me - where‚Äôs that from? I have been in regular contact with Walthamstow residents about that very issue‚Ä¶
@mattzarb You‚Äôve made a massive difference to so many with the win - and you are showing change is possible, it‚Äôs just bloody hard work‚Ä¶sometimes people forget that! üëç

@makinthemost @banebutwoke @ING this is circular. I've used someone's real name rather than batman tag. You think using someone's real name is problematic. I've said I disagree. I hope you think making up fake quotes too is only you've not actually said and don't want to presume? now really its bedtime!
@makinthemost @banebutwoke then you'll need to explain to me how you would wish me to challenge someone @ing me in a message about an offensive fake quote I'm supposed to have said. Oddly enough I don't follow Pete to be able to DM him so...
@makinthemost @banebutwoke I don't think thats the right comparison at all and I do think if you're going to make up fake quotes its entirely understandable the intended target will challenge you on it. If you are local am happy to meet to discuss, and yes we all now need to go to bed! take care!
@wariotifo @banebutwoke @WarToThePalaces guessing consent isn't an etiquette you're too hot on so if you continue I will block you. Please stop. thanks.
@banebutwoke @wariotifo @WarToThePalaces I do my own casework. Please stop spamming my timeline Pete/Bane whatever you wish to call yourself as it makes it harder for me to see stuff on here from Walthamstow residents. Thanks.
@wariotifo @banebutwoke @WarToThePalaces hey both, if you're going to talk about me and be pejorative best not to tag me in these messages- that makes it all seem a bit like a lindsay lohan style burn book of taunts. We've already established you feel very sensitive about twitter etiquette so...stop please? ta.
@makinthemost @banebutwoke except it was on his public timeline. As someone who has worked with various news sources that explicitly remain anonymous for reasons you set out, not putting your name on your timeline let alone making stuff up about others and tweeting it at them all good practice..
@nediaross @banebutwoke fwiw I was checking if this account was from a media source. In all the things I thought today might bring, being told that using a real grown up name is a transgression but fake quotes no biggie wasn't in my twitter post midnight batshit sweepstake. heh - go figure...
Did you know if you go within 50 yards of a Tory and a drum kit it infects you with right wing views and makes you incapable of making up your own mind. Even with the protection of jangly guitar music. I mean I read it on twitter so it must be true so....#gotobedallofyou https://t.co/GyI3Yme8Dd
@makinthemost @banebutwoke If you are a walthamstow resident Matt feel free to get in touch - we can talk through your concern about me using someone's real name and my concern that someone is attributing a fake quote to me. I'm sure you'd also be worried by that?
@WarToThePalaces @banebutwoke yep- so please stop spamming my timeline with these messages as means I don't see the messages from Walthamstow residents with casework.
@jelly_pack @willuminare @banebutwoke @ZinnTruther it seems so - I saw it and chose to use his actual name in replying to the fake quote he attributed to me. I'm guessing twitters had a rough day and all a bit overtired.
@willuminare @banebutwoke @ZinnTruther one day you're going to read back these kinds of messages and feel very silly. Until then please don't contact me again- fwiw given your concern that pete here is traumatised by being called pete I'd imagine your message is very upsetting to him.
@makinthemost @banebutwoke its on his twitter account. Really. Now please don't contact me again cross because I used someone's real name rather than their made up twitter handle in challenging them about a fake quote they have attributed to me. thanks.
@banebutwoke thats ok Pete- for record I don't want your managers name, but do hope you think twice about making up fake quotes and circulating them as whatever platform its really not cool...even for 'bane' ....definitely sort of thing commissioner gordon would disapprove of etc etc
@willuminare @banebutwoke @ZinnTruther um no, I looked at his publicly available twitter feed where he said 'my name is pete'. I'm not going to call someone fake names when asking them why making up fake quotes tbh....
@fishplums @wariotifo @banebutwoke yep meant twitter not facebook. Hope you'll also be concerned about suggestion fake quotes ok Jonathan?
@ofthesparrows @Tom_Gann @banebutwoke @ZinnTruther er yes it is. Am sure you're also even more concerned about someone circulating fake quotes on here?
@wariotifo @banebutwoke I've just said it was Twitter not Facebook. Original question to Pete about why write such a thing still stands. I'm guessing by this that question isn't going to get answered so best to stop this now. Thanks and good night.
@wariotifo @banebutwoke yep apols meant Twitter. Its late at night and I'm getting my social medias confused. Not confused though that someone making up a quote and claiming I have said it should be accountable for their action.
@wariotifo @banebutwoke nope. This is now really strange. Please stop as am sure your mum would say its past your bedtime too...
@Tom_Gann @ofthesparrows @banebutwoke @ZinnTruther well er would you not like me to call you Tom given that's your name? I'm going to give the game away but pretty sure that's not actually bane...especially given #spoiler bane meets a sticky end in the dark knight rises....
Hi @banebutwoke its not really creepy for me to use your real name when you its on your twitter timeline as per below. On the otherhand, tweeting fake quotes which you claim are something I said at me and then refusing to explain why this ok ....pretty creepy tbh.. https://t.co/gKUlcp0sN8
@banebutwoke @ZinnTruther Hi peter why are you making up quotes from Labour MPs and circulating them on Facebook? how is that acceptable?
Powerful and important film from @katierazz on @BBCNewsnight tonight about the UK Yellow Vest movement and the stories told to fuel not just anger and hatred, but also to generate violence and aggression. Well worth seeking out.

Do explain @ellie_merton what my 'underhand' relationship with Labour Friends of Israel is, only I've never been a member?

PLP meant to be private meeting but yes that‚Äôs a fair record of what I said. And the anger feel this brilliant movement is in this situation. However hard it will be and however many abusive messages you send will always speak up for best labour values #kindergentlerpolitics https://t.co/gJtGi3Kos0
This is wrong. Tackling anti semitism nothing to do with being supportive of Palestinian rights. The people of both Israel and Palestine deserve better from the left than the lazy allegation you can support the rights of one only at the expense of the other. https://t.co/NQzqBRc3Jy
@normanbagley1 @DPJHodges Yes yes am sure it‚Äôs all true, but do try not to be a teenage girl copying in snarky messages to someone about them to make yourself meaningful. It‚Äôs a terrible thing we have to teach them not to do to have self worth, in a supposed adult it‚Äôs unforgivable‚Ä¶

@Eds_Benedict if anyone called you that this morning and is from walthamstow please do report this as that kind of abuse has no place in any political movement, let alone one which seeks to support equality through equal representation. I'll stand with you in doing so.
Politics is about how you fight for a better future &amp; values that keep you going through storms and sunshine, not who you hate &amp; the badges that you wear. As someone Labour to my core who never ducks a fight I know today Labour has to learn from what's happened, and not lash out.

It is possible to want a Labour Government AND want to eradicate anti-semitism from the labour movement. Indeed, perhaps 'martin' rather than demanding deselection of MPs who speak out on it, reflect on why standing up for anti-racism principles makes powerful case for office.. https://t.co/UrTFU1UOoH

No. This house is elected and has final say on Brexit. A citizens assembly is selected by random to reflect British society. Doesn‚Äôt replace MPs but in this awful environment would be focused on issues at hand and helping break this behaviour as well as deadlock. https://t.co/9rivTQHAT1

@fabsternation @ClairehairE17 @UncalmItalian Fabian. I said would vote against. I voted against. I have fought for FOM not just today but for past two years.

@declanganley @montie @john_mcguirk @senatornoone I can understand you opposed the outcome, and respect that, but that isn't the same as questioning the methodology or the evidence. One can lose an argument without having to claim it was unfair to have it. You've made an assertion that just isn't true about the evidence.

@cfinnecy Haven‚Äôt suggested you are - I asked a question to ascertain which one you went to?
A citizens assembly is not a focus group. It‚Äôs a very different recruitment method and process - have a read of the involve blog to understand how it‚Äôs done and methodology? https://t.co/ONmE3QTo5V
@NickBent @lisanandy Sorry to hear you say this nick - it‚Äôs not an either or and it‚Äôs not a tiny unelected ctte or a replacement for MPs but a new way of doing decisions. It‚Äôs worked in Ireland, Canada, Iceland, France and Australia to help resolve deadlock. Let‚Äôs be democrats as well as socialists!

@cfinnecy @YvetteCooperMP @lisanandy its not an opinion poll. Its a grown up deliberation of the issues and an opportunity to feed into the decision making of MPs. Have a look at Ireland before deciding no?
Its not an either or- a citizens assembly could hear the case for a second referendum, as well as no deal or the PMs deal or any other deal. Would offer feedback to MPs who still make final decision. It could even recommend the 2nd ref question. Its a process not an outcome. https://t.co/VsxFZ3WnxL

No we don‚Äôt. We have elected representatives from political parties. A citizens assembly is a different mechanism designed to enable public to feed into the parliamentary decision making process - it doesn‚Äôt replace MPs, it advises them so public voices can be heard in debate. https://t.co/0aEAWibLbK
Yep. I‚Äôm a phattie ‚Ä¶. https://t.co/q7rnHpgYjk

@daveclementsltd Hi Dave thanks for getting in touch - happy to discuss both Brexit and youth violence so get in touch if you want to do so? Have been doing public meetings on both which all are welcome to go to?
Three MPs @Vernon_Coaker @JohnCryerMP and myself all calling for urgent government attention to be given to youth violence and murder of Jayden moodie today in parliament but no commitment from government to give proper time to this today. Will keep trying and pushing!
Just asked govt for urgent debate on the help and support children who have been excluded from mainstream schools get as part of preventing youth violence. They are doing review but as yet no update - this is too important and deserves government time and attention.
He is - both @JohnCryerMP and I met with Cressida dick yesterday and working on how to push for more resources too. https://t.co/5VYmEbtmFb
To the anonymous coward who took the time to ring into my office to leave an abusive message about the cause of death of Jayden moodie - a 14 year old boy- from a withheld number. Delete my number and get help.
@martinpmitchell Was reporting back what police said to me - have said in interviews it‚Äôs not more police overall.
Waiting to speak to the @BBCr4today about youth violence and the horrific experience of Walthamstow ‚Ä¶.

@willsmith1066 are you therefore suggesting there should be a quota based on demographics? there's 19m refugees in the world and a specific criteria for what constitutes a refugee under the convention - challenge is bureaucracy and cooperation don't meet its ambitions rather than the people?
@willsmith1066 so you want to base processing on if people take a certain route rather than if they fulfil a certain criteria? we can agree the bureaucracy should be better but think disagree that refugees rather than those who lack that political will should be penalised as a result?
@willsmith1066 I don't disagree and have met with the french ambassador to express concerns- is your argument people should just wait for poor bureaucracy to be fixed and be penalised if they don't?
@willsmith1066 can you clarify what you think the bad behaviour is that is rewarded?
@willsmith1066 thanks William - not sure where have questioned rationality, but have questioned logic. If you want to let me know your alternative approach please do?

There's around 1000-1500 refugees stuck in the -4 temperatures and wind and rain in Calais/Dunkirk tonight, including 250 children. Many have been there for months because processing paperwork to deal with asylum claims is so longwinded. Many have a right to be in UK with family.
Between Nov 2017 &amp; 2018, there were 972 reported incidents of human rights abuses in Calais, including 244 reports of police violence. There is evidence police pour bleach into tents of refugees sleeping rough. So spam my twitter all you want and I'll just shout the truth louder.

Britain. So Great it stands up in the world for human rights by saying to torture victims fleeing persecution loudly 'sorry love, not my problem...'

@KathrynLCassidy I know. I'm utterly ashamed Britain behaves like this and tries to dehumanise those fleeing persecution as an excuse not to act rather than helping lead the response in Europe to ensure every country pulls their weight.
I've worked with people stuck in the hell that is Calais. I've seen the medical reports of the torture they have experienced. Their tents slashed by the French police. The lack of bureaucrats to process claims. A good home secretary would spend money on them not building walls. https://t.co/oXIU65wOnm
How do you know? Have you done the claim for them to know? Why do you think Frances asylum system so perfect ? Closing your eyes and pretending they aren‚Äôt people with rights who deserve dignity doesn‚Äôt make you human sir, it just makes you culpable. https://t.co/AQvcTCrSgq

That‚Äôs your passport @CPhilpOfficial. The travel documents you need to cross borders etc. Not a document you just have to live as you have done for decades in UK as many EU nationals have. Not same thing at all. Pay to stay a tax on just living a life here.. https://t.co/BwnDNeiUBF
So bit of an update  - pay to stay not a copy of an existing policy targeting UK nationals in EU countries @CPhilpOfficial but a tax you are putting on EU nationals here in UK solely‚Ä¶*fears this may give Tory govt ideas though about how else to squeeze taxpayers‚Ä¶üôÉ* https://t.co/eg5rWi19aY
@CPhilpOfficial Hello chris and a belated happy Christmas to you. Interesting approach you are taking there to public service workers - If you think a pay to stay tax is such a great way to treat EU citizens can you explain why you are only bringing it in now then? ü§®
Does this mean the Chingford tories will be on the doorsteps extolling the virtues of the pay to stay policy then @John_J_C_Moss ? Like the people who help keep whipps x going? Thought you were against additional taxes ‚Ä¶.ü§® https://t.co/B9Ttn4EiQh

@johnccmay Nope - there was a live action version on telly two days ago. I make no judgment as to whether these programmes are any good, I just wish commissioners would take more chances on new stories too ‚Ä¶ #bahhumbug
@Smartartz @PhelpsieSarah Expressing an opinion on telly that I disagree with Martin on twitter ? Well that will never do‚Ä¶.üôÑüòâ there‚Äôs plenty of cracking Christie adaptations through the years and will wait to see if this can be added. Still want some new stories too though without such baggage..
@suziedoore @Smartartz @PhelpsieSarah For record I haven‚Äôt expressed any opinion about the ‚Äòpiece‚Äô and will watch separately. Am expressing a concern that this Christmas seems to be full of remakes of old classics - it seems particularly striking this year is all‚Ä¶. #bahhumbug üëà
@PhelpsieSarah @Smartartz Heh - did they commission or did you suggest?
@Smartartz @PhelpsieSarah You are taking affront at something different to the point I was making. Tbh as a massive Christie fan it‚Äôs a different question to whether adaption good, as to whether all the stories have been told and now we are retelling them‚Ä¶
@brianhprobert People always try to redo Agatha christie and yet each is inevitably infused with the impact of the first adaptation. Joan hicksons eyebrow in every marple, ustinov‚Äôs wobble shadowing every Poirot ‚Ä¶
@Smartartz @PhelpsieSarah It‚Äôs opinion. I am allowed an opinion. I am struck by how many rewrites there are - it‚Äôs not a comment on their quality, it‚Äôs a frustration that original stories are in short supply‚Ä¶telling me I am uninformed because you disagree is also an opinion‚Ä¶.
Watership down. Sound of music and now Poirot. All remade for Christmas. Guess it sums up how rubbish 2018 has been that everyone is too tired to do original thought even in telly ‚Ä¶ #bahhumbug

@theskintimmer Don‚Äôt use someone‚Äôs status - their skin colour, their religion, their ethnicity, their sexuality or their gender-to berate them if you want a more equal society where people treated by what they do and say not who they are. It‚Äôs a simple principle and not that hard to understand.
This is not the right response brocialists. Calling women tories for supporting colleagues in being their best self is the right thing to do. If you don‚Äôt think equality matters get out of the labour movement as you are not welcome. #21stcenturycalling https://t.co/BMuzDilQcS

@Demotivatrix It takes 8 weeks max. There is time.

PM telling us the backstop will not be used. But if it were to be used wouldn‚Äôt be indefinite. But then if it‚Äôs not to be used why do we need a process to trigger it at all? It‚Äôs like listening to Yoda- All of this is timewasting. No vote. There cannot be no no vote. #brexithaos
No it‚Äôs not - in other countries citizens assemblies are used to complement the work of elected officials by enabling the public to inform the decision making process. It strengthens democracy to work with them rather than diluting it. https://t.co/7tawxEz3fA

@chrislawer Thank you for sending me examples of CAs.....from wikipedia...
@SewarRat if you're a popper fan then you should realise most of your statements don't meet his tests on falsification. Citizens assemblies are a process not an outcome.
@SewarRat so you used to help run deliberative processes and have a phd in the psychology of participation? goodness. WHAT a coincidence...
If you want a referendum, the law requires months of consultation on the question alone. A citizens assembly can be done in six weeks - eight if you want to go large. There's there's time. https://t.co/cvNaDxjV8x
Actually we don't. No one can lay claim to know exactly what the public think as they've not been asked at all - a citizens assembly is a way of having a grown up conversation with a representative sample about how to break the deadlock. https://t.co/RoZqRVcltH
@carolmurphy2013 @lanceloto no. And fwiw I'm suggesting 500 people given issue at stake. Have you any experience of a citizens assembly to drawn upon? other countries do these all the time as part of better democratic practice...
@OwenSpottswoode not in all cases- there's been plenty of citizens assemblies around the world that haven't chosen referendums too. Its a process not an outcome...
@bentoth @georgeeaton a citizens assembly is about where the public are at, not the politicians....
@SewarRat its not an either or- have you had any experience of a citizens assembly to decide they are counter to representative democracy?
Today is your last chance to win dinner with me and Hibo Wardere this Wednesday in London for just ¬£4 - tickets here and draw takes place tonight!... https://t.co/CHaR035H7U
@Gareth_Blues A new referendum by law requires at least 12 weeks of consultation on the question alone. A citizens assembly is another way where all sides can be heard in helping break the deadlock - its something different to a referendum.
out of interest there @SewarRat who do you think MPs should be listening to then.... https://t.co/550HrdW8fo
erm...as I've never met you @dfromthep, don't follow you or haven't read your tweets before I'm not really in a position to say ? https://t.co/EM29W7L6Rn
@ImIncorrigible have you ever looked at or watched a citizens assembly to decide it is not 'better informed' than the previous debate?
The citizens assembly wouldn‚Äôt  make any final decision on Brexit. It‚Äôs about listening and learning from the public on their views as they hear from all sides of a debate and make recommendations to parliament on how to break the deadlock. It‚Äôs not a referendum. https://t.co/VJr3Qo5DgI
You make it representative of the British public. Like they made it representative of the irish public when they did them on same sex marriage and abortion or climate change or ageing population‚Ä¶it‚Äôs really not that novel an idea‚Ä¶ https://t.co/hTP2nzCI97
Spoiler ‚Ä¶there isn‚Äôt at present so we need a process to help break that deadlock which has the confidence of the public and isn‚Äôt the PM sitting on her hands until deadline day‚Ä¶. https://t.co/8WAbAzc1Kx
It‚Äôs not a replacement for parliament - unless you think the multiple citizens assemblies in Ireland, Australia, canada etc have replaced theirs which they would dispute- but it could be a way of the public helping break the deadlock our parliament is in by giving their views. https://t.co/2pCoTl4vLF
No this is something different - it‚Äôs a short process that allows the public to hear from all sides in a discussion and make recommendations back to parliament. They are used all around the world to get public views on something and inform decision making. https://t.co/TO3AMTHnlp
Because that‚Äôs not a grown up and reasonable way to resolve something controversial. On the other hand, as the Irish, Canadians, Australians, Icelandic and many more have found asking the public to give feedback can be a good way to break deadlock over difficult issues. https://t.co/CUWwZd3BPd
It‚Äôs a randomly selected long list of 10,000 people and then from within that 500 people who reflect the demography and regions of UK. Other countries are able to do this so it‚Äôs really not rocket science. https://t.co/YRPEAp0OdM

government wonder why there‚Äôs so much suspicion about whether they are going to try to avoid a vote at all on brexit deal. When I asked minister if he had consulted attorney general on advice he gave about constitutional process, minister told me to go and ask him myself! ü§®
Walthamstow - will do another Facebook live update session on Brexit at around 1.15-1.30pm today subject to the start of debates etc so keep an eye out on my Facebook page and please do come and ask your questions - can‚Äôt promise I will know the answers but will try! #brexithaos
Twitter what did we say about using the inter web without your mums permission? ü§® https://t.co/buVJQXGm4g

Walthamstow at 4.30 - 4.15pm will be on Facebook live to do quick update on what‚Äôs happened today on Brexit - will be on my page so join me there to ask your questions! #brexithaos
Parliament packed to the rafters to be told the Brexit vote for tomorrow is ‚Äòdeferred‚Äô. PM now saying she will go back and look again at backstop to appease the Brexiteers but it‚Äôs her own red line. Hard to see anything changing so this deadlock continues #brexithaos
Public message to those claiming to be local residents ringing my office to shout at my staff about Brexit. Happy to speak to anyone who is actually a local resident however they voted - but be a grown up and make appointment, don‚Äôt take your anger out on my team! #brexithaos
Very concerned by the management of the #stansted15 case and the use of terrorism legislation to prosecute - I fear with everything else going on won‚Äôt get the scrutiny it deserves and what consequences that will be both for those involved and the law itself‚Ä¶
Plot twist #2 this morning....its not just brexit that's struggling but our very democracy. Unless we sort both, this chaos will just get worse....#brexithaos https://t.co/USouqKpSVm

@EULondonMark @andrewhj @anandMenon1 @sjwrenlewis no point is to give a CA real power and real meaning - doing things differently a way to break the deadlock and that includes not using them just to air issues but way to move forward with those who disagree on outcomes.
@andrewhj @EULondonMark @anandMenon1 @sjwrenlewis its a serious decision making process to address the deadlock which draws its power from its inclusivity and engagement - we have enough talking shops in hogwarts to rehearse issues so really don't need more....
@anandMenon1 @andrewhj @EULondonMark @sjwrenlewis that's not unique to CAs- its one of the problems with our current democratic framework is it has a monochrome palette of options to move forward which value conflict, rather than learning from others on value of being open to deliberation to find consensus on process.
@jillongovt @EULondonMark @anandMenon1 @andrewhj bit surprised you're dismissing something straight away we haven't even explored a brief for or appetite - haven't we had enough of that recently? how else are you going to break the deadlock?
@andrewhj @EULondonMark @anandMenon1 @sjwrenlewis my fear here is seems some posts are projecting outcomes onto a CA rather than understanding the value is the process. No one wants a nice earnest debate as a sideline - we need to break the deadlock by doing democracy differently full stop.
@jillongovt @EULondonMark @anandMenon1 @andrewhj really not sure what you are asking the CA to do? and of course, the politicians have come up with something negotiable so.....
@anandMenon1 @andrewhj @EULondonMark what are you basing that opinion on?
@anandMenon1 @andrewhj @EULondonMark no it really doesn't - it IS about the process and how it works, and whether it is powerful, inclusive and transparent. Really important we don't suggest methods are somehow specific but instead identify the barriers to using them as specific.
@anandMenon1 @andrewhj @EULondonMark CA's aren't specific to a certain type of question nor country as lots use them - its the process, not the policy, that matters.
@anandMenon1 @andrewhj @EULondonMark really? how?

No I'm clearly not saying that. A citizens jury isn't a referendum. These may be new to Britain but they aren't new to democracy. And its a way to break the political deadlock over a people's vote.

@DimifromPowys If you want to continue exchange please can you answer the question posed? Because if you can‚Äôt, if all you can offer is you have sat on sidelines telling others someone should do something then that isn‚Äôt socialism. And that‚Äôs what I am interested in working on, not whinges..
@danmaclane @ChrisLeslieMP Am happy to discuss and catch up if you want? FWIW momentum now clear they are a party not political entity. Like Cameron I am wary of anyone who seeks power for the sake of it rather than for a purpose - have challenged all those who do that and will continue to do so!

@moleyhtfc @KathH3 @Trickyjabs @ChrisLeslieMP I know it‚Äôs easier to hide behind a twitter account with chris Morris on it and take pot shots rather than be a change maker yourself sir but honestly it‚Äôs such a waste of everyone‚Äôs time.

@DimifromPowys @KathH3 @Trickyjabs @ChrisLeslieMP loyalty isn‚Äôt being unthinking and unquestioning.

@KathH3 @Trickyjabs @ChrisLeslieMP FWIW have told every labour leader when I have disagreed and when I agree - why are you dismissing my voice now?

Nope. The assembly decides the questions for the referendum rather than politicians. Everyone could give evidence to it but only the assembly members vote. They did this in Ireland to set abortion referendum question and changed whole tone of debate #peoplenotpoliticians https://t.co/iJbjJR2lcQ

So challenge the #BannonBoys about their idea liberation for women is about telling them what to wear rather than challenging those who try to control women and this is the kind of stuff you get back - but no definitely not trying to use feminism to shield their racism ‚Ä¶ü§®üôÑü§® https://t.co/pz8aLn2BMP
You're the "real" liberators are you @raheemkassam? in that case, if you can just give a list of 'liberating' clothes you think women should be given freedom to choose to wear that would be great...thank goodness for all these woke #bannonboys able to set us right ey ladies... https://t.co/2C1WiMSqtB
Would welcome any late convert to the merits of feminism from any direction, but demeaning women as 'letterboxes' and then claiming its freedom of speech ain't liberation, its objectifying and shouldn't be confused for any form of solidarity..#weseeyouboris #seeyoutoobannonboys https://t.co/T4bgpRN1NQ

@notroublejo You've got a record of the invite to the event from February? not sure what that proves except that you are clutching at straws here in an manufactured personal attack on a Labour MP. I'm going to block you now if you don't stop as clear this is malicious.
@notroublejo by continuing this bizarre attack and refusing to accept you're wrong, you make any action look less about the people affected and more about point scoring. I'm going to ask you to stop now and have given clear evidence such an allegation wrong.
@notroublejo That clearly says 6.30 start but even so. I was in westminster. You obviously don't know walthamstow if you think its physically possible to get to college in less than 50 mins from central london. And didn't leave until much later as went to leytonstone..
@notroublejo and before you try to suggest I was in Walthamstow that day, Hansard record of the Education bill was serving on and the debates we were having. In Westminster. Don't accuse me of crossing picket lines to try to further your agenda, as demeans unions! 2/2 https://t.co/rDr4qGXxk3
@notroublejo Emails from me to strike organisers and local trades council showing time and date stamps as was in Office. Not physically possible to be at college at time of picket and in Westminster at same time 1/2 https://t.co/UuEFccPZpb
@notroublejo @JohnClarke1960 @xpressanny @tom_watson @DerbyChrisW so now I'm james bond style breaking and entering a public building with security? this is now very silly. i've explained why you're wrong, given evidence to that effect and you continue with this story. I think this conversation is at an end.
@notroublejo @JohnClarke1960 @xpressanny @tom_watson @DerbyChrisW so hang on- you mean the people outside didn't notice? only I've checked and have emails from the picket line organisers.....hmm.....
@notroublejo @JohnClarke1960 @xpressanny @tom_watson @DerbyChrisW I have no idea who you are. This was a labour party fundraising event to help raise funds to fight the conservatives- feel free to reach out to people. If you can find anyone to corroborate your story that I was at the college that night will be gobsmacked (who isn't SWP...)
@notroublejo @JohnClarke1960 @xpressanny @tom_watson @DerbyChrisW How could I have phoned someone who i don't know from a mobile phone as wouldn't have your number?! enough of this madness - I have work to do and you have conspiracies to promote. Sorry you think this is ok but its not.
@notroublejo @JohnClarke1960 @xpressanny @tom_watson @DerbyChrisW I have no idea who you are to have rung you at all, and i was never at the college that night as was in my office trying to sort out alternative venue (pretty sure parliament phone records would confirm that). So we are at an impasse. Sorry not to be able to fit your narrative..
@notroublejo @JohnClarke1960 @xpressanny @tom_watson @DerbyChrisW this is honestly just balderdash. I rang the union to find out what was going on, the organisers inside to check they were ok (as kids were in tears) and the restaurants I knew locally to find alternative venue. Don't think you're any of those!
@notroublejo @JohnClarke1960 @xpressanny @tom_watson @DerbyChrisW I have no idea who you are so i certainly didn't ring you, and i definitely didn't cross any picket line - I was too busy in my office ringing alternative venues! Promoting such a lie makes you look foolish at best and malicious at worst. Why not fight the tories instead...
@notroublejo @JohnClarke1960 @xpressanny @tom_watson @DerbyChrisW Fascinating both of you seem to think sharing online lies about someone won't get picked up. For record a) I've never been to private school and b) no i didn't cross any picket line. Indeed, when you picketed the student dinner I was the one who organised alternative venue....

@kaysillars @Beathhigh @sdrhod no marple knew how to live - she travelled the world soaking it all in without tying her self to one person or one city. Then when she was ready St Mary Mead became a bolthole from which to enjoy all the 'nephews' and 'nieces' she gathered along the way...
This from @_GlitchUK a good balance for how social media companies can cut out the abuse from their platforms to put free speech for all back centre stage. https://t.co/B8MwxUC1IS
@Beathhigh @sdrhod I think marple led a wild youth, breaking hearts and cracking criminal follies through searing psychological analysis whilst avoiding ending up being married to a boring tache obsessed belgian man. Gin kept her going- I've looked and I've not read that yet...
@sdrhod I feel very torn on poirot- honest truth is I want to like it but just think marple a better drawn character. I'd love to write her early years novels - what say you @Beathhigh ? that's definitely a midlife crisis surely....

because saying women should not to be shamed by Boris about what they choose to wear means you must hate all men? when did Boris become the spokesperson for masculinity? was there a special vote- with yorkie bars or something as ballots? #jogon https://t.co/P2gacVI0fn
@tomhfh um, why are you putting kisses at the ends of your messages to Labour women MPs?
@tomhfh anyone ever told you what to wear and threatened to withhold services if you don't comply? see trouble is tom just think Boris probably needs some different advisors right now if he's going to rescue his leadership bid...but am sure effort rewarded so...
@tomhfh @ayestotheright oh bless you Tom for being so determined to get a job with boris that you can't read text properly and understand the concept of shaming - I really do hope it works out for you if it means that much...
@tomhfh @ayestotheright So are you now saying its ok to seek to control what women wear as long as you don't actually legislate for it? just whip up hatred for them instead? as for idea its #fakenews 'sarah', think you're being a little bit disingenuous....but you know, nice audition piece so....
@tomhfh @ayestotheright The premise of your question is that because other countries have engaged in telling women what to wear Boris isn‚Äôt being Bannon or I mustn‚Äôt raise concerns? Or is it that it‚Äôs ok to float it just not do it? Just clarifying what I am allowed to think under his eye‚Ä¶.
@tomhfh @ayestotheright Generally telling women what to wear and deciding you know what they think or feel in spite of their own opinions not a great look even for guidoboys‚Ä¶.still blessed be the fruits yeah?
Dear Tory leadership voters - one of the potential candidates thinks you want Bannon not Boris on the ballot paper. Make sure you tell him being a Buffoon not being a racist and misogynist more British and more your bag before he goes full morrissey‚Ä¶ #21stcenturycalling https://t.co/3FfifuotUx

Of course, the four other Tory MPs who the chief whip allegedly called and asked to break the whip and so know he did this deliberately now have some tremendous leverage whilst he‚Äôs in post‚Ä¶.ü§îü§®üòè
Government ministers won‚Äôt deny chief whip tried to ask other MPs to break the pairing whips last week as well as Brandon lewis - this wasn‚Äôt an honest mistake but a deliberate policy. Only their honestly stopped it - not the chief whips own conduct.
It seems from this briefing that the BBC and officials know more than the ministers making decisions on this at one at despatch box now doesn‚Äôt know this answer. He‚Äôs offered to find out and write to us - so clearly precedent not part of decision making‚Ä¶ https://t.co/mgxUhDTZ7Z
The Rubicon is crossed - govt ministers have decided not to seek assurances on death penalty use and won‚Äôt explain why change in policy. Minister claims Prime Minister agrees with it but downing st briefing elsewise. Justice shouldn‚Äôt mean compromising our principles.

@AbiWilks @nearlylegal @billybragg No my tweet response to someone complaining about me discussing nazi analogies on the daily politics today. It was not the start of the conversation but middle and yet you seem intent on suggesting otherwise. I have made no comment about apartheid analogy as different matter.

@helensclegel It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a reference to my appearance on the daily politics. Don‚Äôt be part of this coordinated attack.
@AbiWilks that's simply not true Abi- I was replying to someone commenting on my appearance on the daily politics today regarding the use of Nazi analogies. Has someone asked you to tweet such a thing?

@GawainKeates @daily_politics @evolvepolitics I was responding to a criticism of me being on tv talking about nazi comparisons. Inconvenient though the truth may be for you, I hope even more if you think those are acceptable you aren‚Äôt a member. Now please do not contact me again.
Yes - I have written to govt calling for independent investigation into idf conduct towards protestors. Yes I voted for Palestinian statehood and support two state solution. Yes I want IHRA in its entirety in labours code of conduct. Hope that helps. https://t.co/jWn8VsexIO
@redtaffcasual Who I sleep with is none of your concern. That you think it is reflects why you shouldn‚Äôt be in the Labour Party. #blocked
@mr_omneo Yes. That tweeter responding to me being on the programme and talking about such comparisons. Everything else now spewing into my timeline is manufactured by those seeking to cause mischief. Don‚Äôt be part of it! ( I know you wouldn‚Äôt wish to be but just saying!)
This is clearly #fakenews as not what I said on @daily_politics  and have never discussed apartheid comparisons. Why do you hate labour so much @evolvepolitics that you would try to promote such a view? Don‚Äôt you want us to win election? I do‚Ä¶. https://t.co/F6vr2TuTV0
The IHRA mentions it. The NEC code discusses it. It‚Äôs a good example of why need clarity IHRA gives that you haven‚Äôt checked. Use of apartheid language a completely different issue. https://t.co/mEzj4yMPEZ
So do so - I do! If you can‚Äôt without making nazi analogies and all that brings with it maybe take a long hard look at history? It‚Äôs really not that complicated a rule‚Ä¶. https://t.co/LrPBABWy51
@mr_omneo The interview I just did on Sunday politics to which the tweeter was reacting?
The IHRA explicit about nazi comparisons. I spoke on tv about my concerns about seeming to downgrade that. God knows what @evolvepolitics on about but demeans it‚Äôs credibility to suggest I said anything else as daily politics footage shows‚Ä¶ https://t.co/gJF4kFgxti
@mr_omneo Can you point to where I have done that or have you been reading evolve politics again? Hope you would understand why nazi comparisons so beyond the pale and explicitly referenced in the IHRA‚Ä¶.
@redtaffcasual Hi if you think women can‚Äôt think for themselves then membership of Labour Party incompatible with such misogyny so really hope you are a bot only‚Ä¶..
Hi there random person - fwiw I am not a member of labour friends of Israel and never have been. I regularly criticise conduct of israeli government - as does LFI - and it‚Äôs perfectly possible to do without making nazi comparisons. https://t.co/kGatMpf2dv
Do you need to make nazi comparisons to call out the conduct of the israeli government? I don‚Äôt and I regularly do inc calling for UN investigations. If you feel such language is appropriate you clearly don‚Äôt know your history or care about pain and distress it causes. https://t.co/Fcw8NEvzXh
