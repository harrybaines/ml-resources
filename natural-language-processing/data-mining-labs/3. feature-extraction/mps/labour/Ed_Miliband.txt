@declankenny94 @CheerfulPodcast It‚Äôs a pretty fair point. I think a point of interest was a Conservative advocating redistribution of wealth on the basis of a thorough report on the issues done by a cross party, cross society commission, including TUC. But your point about collective goods is really important.
The UK must now lead in ensuring that the ambition of the Paris Accord to stop dangerous climate change are matched by national commitments. Ten years on from the world-leading Climate Change Act, others are now more ambitious than us. Time we stepped up. https://t.co/ViyfHYG5uq

Very disappointed for the victims of phone-hacking and press abuse that we did not win the vote for Leveson 2. The battle goes on to keep our promise to them to get the truth they deserve and protection for victims in the future.

There must be no backdoor route to Murdoch getting control of Sky. My question earlier in the House of Commons. https://t.co/TPb1BIgnK2

Murdochs used to say 39% doesn't give control of Sky. Now want to be judged not on record of Fox which they control but Sky which they don't https://t.co/KyiDfmZs8M

8/We cannot write off people who voted for Trump and need to separate them from the man. Many were crying with frustration like Brexit.
7/ None of this is easy, as I know, but what is clear is that the old economic settlement is dead and must be reshaped.
6/But it is also about anti-politics and nationhood which were such a strong part of Trump‚Äôs appeal.
5/For the centre-left it means (again) the need for hard rethinking about how we have bigger economic solutions that speak to the moment.

UK government was right to argue for high ambition and will now rightly be held to this standard in its domestic policy.
If it is agreed,negotiators and campaigners, particularly those from vulnerable countries, deserve huge credit as do the French hosts.
No agreement is perfect but this is remarkable progress. Five-year review essential to raise ambition and meet the new goal of 1.5C.
1.5 C aim, long-term goal of zero emissions, every major country playing a part. A new beginning in the fight against climate change #cop21
Very moving to watch the presentation ceremony at the end of #cop21. Now all we need is the text.....

I spoke earlier in EVEL debate. Govt's proposals true neither to traditions of Conservatism nor Unionism http://t.co/MlekoEmTzG
Diverse voices from @iainmartin1 to @paulmasonnews seem to agree. And just because Britain out of euro, govt shouldn't be voiceless.
by eurozone flies in face of views of IMF, US administration, economics and democracy. (2/2)
Very troubling to see Eurozone actions over last week. Tsipras tactics very odd but bullying and denial of need for debt restructuring (1/2)
Or cut tax credits with vague aspirations on mw, leaving people worse off. A Budget which does that is not one for working people (2/2)
Welcome @SteveHiltonx advocacy of higher mw/living wage. Big question is this: will Budget raise mw and thereby reduce employer subsidy(1/2)
Thanks to Hatfield workers and Labour colleagues who came into debate. Undertaking from minister to look at redundancy payments.
About to debate Hatfield colliery. We need a just, low carbon transition and premature closure of Hatfield is not just or right.
Yes I am pretty sure we are. Others will verify. But I think 60% median income internationally accepted definition. https://t.co/zRrOAt7uQN
"We need to think of poverty in relative terms...some people lack those things which others in society take for granted" Quite.
scraps relative child poverty target. Serious question to those on the right? Of course, opportunity matters but so obviously does income.
Can someone explain why David Cameron said in 2006 that his party "recognises, will measure and will act on relative poverty" &amp; then...(1/2)
@PhilEspM wow thanks
Good news re John Noakes. No truth to ugly (?) rumour I won blue peter badge but I did meet him at kings cross station, aged 7... w/o Shep
Govt scrapped last govt's CCS plan. Now when CCS happens, no indigenous deep coal mine will be open. Another eg of incoherent energy policy.
Report from climate change committee today illustrates Hatfield's problem. CCS was envisaged to start in 2014, now 2020. Govt dither&amp;delay
Full statement on Hatfield...http://t.co/2gSlp01c9D
Before election, government agreed aid. After, not a penny more despite extra revenues from mine staying open. Full statement follows later.
Dark day for workers at Hatfield colliery. Government could and should be doing more to keep pit open till summer 2016 as planned.

Defeats are hard, but we‚Äôre a party that will never stop fighting for the working people of this country.
I am grateful to the people who worked on our campaign and for the campaign they ran. The responsibility for the result is mine alone.
I‚Äôve just thanked Labour‚Äôs staff. They are a credit to our party, and, driven by a passion to serve, they are a credit to our country.
The next government has a huge responsibility to bring our country together. What unites us is much, much more than what divides us.
This has clearly been a very disappointing and difficult night for the Labour party. To every member and supporter, I want to say thank you.
We won't know the result for a while but I want to say thank you to people who knocked on doors &amp; everyone who voted. http://t.co/cuuw6daHIO

Five years ago Nick Clegg promised to scrap tuition fees but he then trebled them. I‚Äôve said I will cut tuition fees. I won‚Äôt break my word.

The Tory plan to cut Child Benefit is now on the ballot paper. This is our new election poster ‚Üí http://t.co/vQcsYfiDxM
Last night, David Cameron was asked if he is planning to cut Child Benefit. He used 600 words to dodge answering, but he didn‚Äôt say no.
I will make sure the deficit is cut every year. I will put working families first. I will fight every day for you as your PM. #bbcqt
I want to be completely clear: there will no coalition and no deals with the SNP. #bbcqt
Thanks for the questions on #bbcqt. There‚Äôs a clear choice. Cameron didn‚Äôt rule out cutting child benefit. I‚Äôll put working families first.
Working families can't afford five more years of the Tories, but in seven days time people can vote Labour to put working families first.
There‚Äôs no question the Tories will cut child benefit if they win, the only question is will David Cameron be honest about it tonight #BBCQT

The Tories' secret plan to cut child benefit &amp; tax credits has been revealed. Working families can't afford five years of the Tories.
The Tories have drawn up plans to take thousands of pounds from millions of families. Child benefit &amp; tax credits are on the ballot paper.

Working families deserve better than the lowest level of peacetime housebuilding for 100 years. Britain can‚Äôt continue like this.
We will get construction started on one million new homes over the next five years. We‚Äôll introduce stable three year tenancies for renters.
For the first three years of the next Labour government, we will abolish stamp duty for all first time buyers of homes under ¬£300,000.
We‚Äôll cap rents so they can‚Äôt rise faster than inflation during a three-year tenancy. Read more about it here ‚Üí http://t.co/CdFWJiKntF

Our communities are changing fast but we don‚Äôt cope with change by closing our doors to each other and living our lives in separate worlds.

On day one of a Labour government we will start to tackle tax avoidance. We believe everyone should play by the same rules.
David Cameron can't tell you where a penny of the money is coming from for his NHS policy. You can't fund the NHS from an IOU.
Labour will provide 3,000 more midwives through our ¬£2.5bn Time to Care Fund to ensure women get the care they need‚Üíhttp://t.co/QoRBAE8ZDY

The NHS is a bedrock of security for working families, but it‚Äôs starting to buckle under unprecedented pressure.
When a serious figure like Tony Blair warns UK national interest is threatened by a Tory 2nd term, people from all parties should take note.

Last night, the Prime Minister tried to defend a recovery that shuts out most working people and an NHS that is going backwards.
We can build a recovery that goes beyond the City to reach everyone. That‚Äôs what I talked about last night, it‚Äôs what the election is about.
I want to say, Nigel Farage's comment about the NHS and HIV was disgusting. He should be ashamed. The fact he isn't says so much.
The choice in this campaign is clear, between the Tories' failing plan &amp; Labour's better plan. If you want change, you need to vote for it.
David Cameron chose the format but he was the invisible man in this debate. He couldn't defend his record on the NHS and extreme cuts.
I am passionate about our vision for action on zero-hours, tuition fees and the NHS. David Cameron had nothing to say tonight.
I enjoyed the People's Question Time event in Bury. I was asked about pressures on NHS staff because of cuts to care https://t.co/Na6Hh3l1zC

If you‚Äôre struggling on a zero-hours contract right now, here‚Äôs what Labour will do for you: http://t.co/Ort41qvTux
A worker who has been on a zero-hours contract asked me a question at my event earlier. This is what I told him: https://t.co/AQukRX6LOg
Zero-hours contracts have become a symbol of the Tories‚Äô failing economy. Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôll tackle them: https://t.co/UIOkMtoRcM
David Cameron said he couldn‚Äôt live on a zero-hours contract. If it‚Äôs not right for him, it‚Äôs not for others either‚Üí https://t.co/Ijz3btHxdJ
If you work regular hours for three months, Labour will give you a legal right to a regular contract, not a zero-hours contract.

I've just launched our campaign. This election matters so much because there's such a stark choice between us and the Tories.
I'm in east London for the launch of our campaign this morning - voters have a big choice in this election. https://t.co/IfsNN53lIO
There's a real choice in this election. Over the next six weeks, I'll be campaigning street-by-street. Get involved: http://t.co/Qpxtf3b29y
Thanks to everyone who watched tonight. We saw the choice on May 7th: Cameron can't defend his record, I will fight for working families.

No one will believe the PM on VAT after he said they weren‚Äôt going to raise it in 2010, and then put it up a few weeks later. #PMQs

The attack in Tunisia was a despicable act of terrorism and it reinforces our determination to stand united against terrorist acts.
My thoughts and deep condolences are with Sally Adey's family and the families of all the victims of yesterday's attacks in Tunisia.
We know the choice at this election. People need a Labour govt that understands Britain only succeeds when working families succeed.
It was a budget people won‚Äôt believe. George Osborne just spent an hour telling people they‚Äôre better off when they know they‚Äôre worse off.
There‚Äôs never been a bigger gap between the rhetoric of the Chancellor‚Äôs speech and the reality of people‚Äôs lives. #Budget2015

I think Nigel Farage's comments today are wrong, divisive and dangerous. The laws we have on equality represent our values as a country.

The Tories‚Äô spending plans are risky and extreme and threaten our public services and living standards: http://t.co/aXCNeNpb2e
.@EdBallsMP has set out the facts - the Tories' extreme &amp; risky spending plans would cut ¬£70bn. Read his speech here: http://t.co/d75L9fYqpa

The election is just two months away. Let‚Äôs stop a Tory decade. http://t.co/yDICSzSMo0
Another Tory government will force cuts of ¬£1 billion to the NHS in Scotland. That's equivalent to: - 15,500 nurses cut - 3,500 GPs cut
Tory cuts after the election would see ¬£2.7 billion taken from Scotland. ¬£500 for every man, woman and child.
The Tories want to take spending back to the levels last seen in the 1930s, before we had the NHS.

Under this government we are building fewer homes than at any time since the 1920s &amp; record numbers of families are being forced to rent.
David Cameron's plan on housing has failed Britain. For far too many families the dream of home ownership is disappearing.

My thoughts are with the people of France as they have faced further terrorist acts today. We stand in solidarity with them.
If I was Prime Minister we would be taking action now to ease pressure on A&amp;E. Read my @DailyMirror interview here: http://t.co/2SqXxwecHf
David Cameron should stand on his record and stop running scared of TV debates.
We stand in solidarity with France against this evil attack by terrorists intent on attacking our democratic way of life &amp; freedom of speech

Labour will make sure the NHS in England has the time to care. With Labour: 20,000 nurses 8,000 GPs 5,000 care workers 3,000 midwives
The Tories‚Äô NHS crisis means more patients than ever on record are waiting over 4 hours in A&amp;E. Only Labour will protect our NHS.

Terrible news from Glasgow ‚Äì my thoughts are with all those affected by this horrific accident.
It's been #DecentJobsWeek. Here's what I think: https://t.co/TbxWZ5whXK It's great that the TUC have drawn attention to these issues.
Work isn‚Äôt just the place where you earn your pay. Read my piece on Decent Jobs Week: https://t.co/vMtNQEmTKj #DecentJobsWeek
David Cameron must take responsibility for the NHS going backwards. His ¬£3bn reorganisation led to the loss of thousands of frontline staff

Our second election pledge: we will control immigration fairly: http://t.co/XpdNL8o256
The next @UKLabour government will control immigration with fair rules on benefits and at work.
We are serving notice on employers who bring workers here under duress or on false terms &amp; pay them significantly lower wages.
Today I'm announcing the next Labour government will make it a criminal offence to undercut pay or conditions by exploiting migrant workers.
Congratulations @JimMurphyMP &amp; @KDugdaleMSP - look forward to working with you both to build a fairer Scotland.
Great to meet former agency workers at BT call centre in Doncaster now on permanent contracts thanks to BT and CWU working together

Labour will get the deficit down &amp; balance the books. But we will never take Britain back to the 1930s: http://t.co/7nSjvPvVcs
Our economic plan: We‚Äôll devolve ¬£30 billion to regions &amp; cities, empowering local people to create jobs &amp; improve public services.
Our economic plan: Fully funded manifesto commitments, with no additional borrowing. Not unfunded tax cuts that threaten the NHS.
Our economic plan: Sensible reductions in spending, not the Tory slash and burn of public services.
Our economic plan: We‚Äôll get the current budget into surplus and the national debt falling, but we won‚Äôt destroy productive investment.
Our tough and balanced approach will raise living standards and ensure working people and services are protected as we deal with the deficit
The Tories' ¬£7bn unfunded tax cuts expose their ideological commitment to shrinking public services, no matter the consequences.
David Cameron‚Äôs plan for Britain‚Äôs future will take spending on public services back to the 1930s: a time before the NHS.
Labour will not take risks with public finances and we will not take risks with public services.
Labour will get the deficit down and create the strong economic foundation needed to build a prosperous Britain and protect public services.
We won‚Äôt forget the 50% of young people who choose not to go to university. We will invest in their future: http://t.co/nJanzz9gW3

He is a towering figure in British politics because, for a generation, he helped make the political weather and change our country.
On behalf of the Labour Party I want to thank Gordon Brown for his outstanding 32-year parliamentary career.
Britain needs a recovery for working people so we squeeze the deficit, not the middle.
Low pay and stagnant salaries, combined with soaring housing costs, is helping cause extra borrowing.
Tory failure to tackle the cost-of-living crisis has cost ¬£116.5 billion ‚Äì leading to Tory failure on the deficit too.
Britain will only prosper by tackling the cost-of-living crisis &amp; building a recovery which works for the many. http://t.co/GGHBHPpc9J
Happy St Andrew's Day to those celebrating in Scotland and the UK. We all share the responsibility to build a better future together.

Devolution should not just be for one part of the UK. On my way to Sunderland to talk about giving more power to communities across England
My promise to the people of Scotland: Elect a Labour govt in May and we‚Äôll implement the Smith Commission in our first Queen‚Äôs Speech.
Great to be in Glasgow this morning talking about Labour's commitment to devolving power to people across the UK.
We'll tackle exploitation of migrant workers that undercuts local workers &amp; make migrants pay in for 2 years before they can claim benefits
David Cameron promised the British people he'd cut net migration. It‚Äôs gone up. He has broken his promise.
Further powers to Scotland is just a first step. People in England and Wales want more control over their lives too. Labour will deliver it.
Labour made a promise to the people of Scotland that we would deliver stronger powers for the Scottish Parliament: we kept that promise.
I'm deeply saddened by the appalling attack on British embassy staff in Kabul. My thoughts are with the families of those killed and injured
Absolutely devastating news about Phil Hughes. My thoughts are with his family, friends &amp; the world of cricket this morning.
The PM is in complete denial about the state of our NHS. Across the country people are waiting longer in A&amp;E and can‚Äôt get to see their GP.
We must learn the lessons from Fusilier Lee Rigby‚Äôs murder and remind ourselves of the threat we face in keeping our country safe.
Fusilier Lee Rigby‚Äôs murder was an appalling act. My thoughts are again with his family and friends today.

My deepest sympathies go to the family of Abdul-Rahman Kassig today. These brutal killers must face justice.

My speech today will tell you what I think the election is all about - follow @UKLabour and I‚Äôll be back on Twitter later with more.
@UtopianFireman It's been shambolic. Firefighters risk their lives to save ours &amp; deserve better. That's why I've signed the Commons motion.
@getthewashingin @DJFlo70 The bedroom tax &amp; Health &amp; Social Care Act will go. We won't just undo Tory damage: we'll improve Britain for all.
@horatioharry @CharlieWoof81 @itsourian  I won‚Äôt! I‚Äôll change the law so 16 and 17-year-olds can vote.
@featuresuk To show people that we don‚Äôt have to have a country that only works for a few powerful people. Britain can work for everyone.
@JadeFrancesAzim ‚Ä¶ tackling rip-off fees that make renting so expensive, high quality vocational training, and votes at 16.
@JadeFrancesAzim We‚Äôve got lots to help young people out: a jobs guarantee, better apprenticeships and more of them, building more homes‚Ä¶
@JadeFrancesAzim We need to show young people that voting can achieve change - &amp; if they vote Labour we *will* change Britain for the better

@itsourian Labour is the party of work, of the NHS, of fighting for fairness, equality and progress.
@itsourian I don't have a daughter but I'd tell my sons that Labour is a party for everyone, not just a powerful few.
@DJFlo70 I won‚Äôt let you down. As I said yesterday, it‚Äôs time we changed Britain so it works for everyone, not just a powerful few.
@yorksfella59 @CharlieWoof81 Together we can save it, and we will. But we have to fight hard to make sure we win in May. #6monthstowin
@Makrina91 He doesn't understand that his recovery is working only for a few. We have to change the country so it works for everyone.

@huxley06 Thanks, although even I would concede that photo-wise it doesn't work out every time...
@Sharonavraham Another example of the shambolic Tory leadership saying one thing and doing another. They take the British people for fools.
@Harryslaststand You‚Äôre an inspiration. I will keep working to build on the great country you &amp; your generation of Labour supporters gave us
@LabourEoin @David_Cameron is strong on the weak, but weak on the strong. I promise I will always stand up for those who need me.
@LabInSpiRed @jon_swindon  I promise never to lose sight of the fact that @UKLabour is a party #forthemany
@CharlieWoof81 I don‚Äôt need to tell you that Labour built the NHS &amp; saved it before from Tory hands. Together we will do it again.

Congratulations to Labour‚Äôs @AlanBillingsPCC ‚Äì he will bring experience, independence and a fresh start to South Yorkshire police.

3 million British jobs and thousands of British businesses rely on the EU. I won't be the Prime Minister that puts that at risk.

We want an NHS with the time to care. We'll invest ¬£2.5 billion in the NHS for 20,000 nurses, 8,000 GPs, 5,000 care workers, 3,000 midwives.
I'll repeal David Cameron's Health and Social Care Act which puts privatisation and competition at the heart of the health service.
A Labour government would guarantee a GP appointment within 48 hours &amp; a same-day consultation with a doctor or nurse for those who need it.
Under David Cameron, it has got harder and harder to get a GP appointment. One-in-four patients wait a week or more to see their GP.

Have a look at the BBC report on Ed Balls' important speech &amp; Labour's priorities in office: http://t.co/hQveCuapEG http://t.co/lBMjWmouY7
It's great young members have a chance to be at Labour conference. Read what some of them had to say about their week http://t.co/GtwUrnSCYb
Our proposal will mean a pay cut of ¬£7,125 for the PM. As we make tough decisions to balance the books all ministers must take the lead.
A Labour government I lead will cut government ministers' pay by 5% - and block any pay rises until the books are balanced.
A Labour government will have to take tough decisions. That will include capping child benefit. We‚Äôll also cut and cap minister's pay.
As Prime Minister, I'd raise the minimum wage to ¬£8 an hour by 2020: http://t.co/iCGedL8zES http://t.co/ldVNvD2x8v
People are treading water, working harder just to stay afloat. That's why we have a plan to raise the minimum wage to ¬£8 an hour. #lab14
I‚Äôll be on the @MarrShow shortly. We want to raise the minimum wage to ¬£8p/h. Here‚Äôs what I told the Observer: http://t.co/17mqcu61LC
We will deliver on our promise of further powers to Scotland on the timetable set out during the referendum campaign.
Change doesn‚Äôt end today - it begins today. Full text of my speech in Glasgow this morning: http://t.co/uYd4YrD1UO
Our United Kingdom is stronger today than it was yesterday.

RT@Margaret_Curran In 12 hours, people across Scotland will start voting. Here are 5 questions you should be asking. http://t.co/4I5dIuutY3
No means better, faster, safer change for Scotland. It means more powers for the Scottish Parliament &amp; the NHS, pensions &amp; jobs protected.
This will be a highlight of #Lab14. @BilldeBlasio speaking on how we can help working people in the US &amp; the UK: http://t.co/kxb5T9TfYA
Our focus now must be to listen to the victims and learn from the past to ensure this can never happen again.
It is right Shaun Wright has resigned. He was in a position of responsibility when the abuse scandal happened.
David Haines was somebody whose only purpose was to help innocent people, themselves victims of conflict.
I am sickened at the disgusting, barbaric killing of David Haines.
5 days left until the #indyref. A no vote means better, faster, safer change for Scotland. Here‚Äôs how you can help: http://t.co/M32n8R8KTD

We want cities, towns and villages across the UK to fly the Saltire and send a message to Scotland: stay with us.
Fantastic to hear that Prince George will soon be a big brother! Congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their happy news.
I will miss Jim‚Äôs friendship and decency. On behalf of the Labour Party, I offer our sincere condolences to his wife and children.
Jim Dobbin's death is a sad day for Parliament. He was a dedicated public servant, representing the people of Rochdale for three decades.
The Darlo Mums are a true inspiration. I‚Äôm proud the whole Labour movement has come together to support their campaign for the NHS
Please help support No Thanks, add a #Twibbon now! http://t.co/q1SK6OATTC
In just 8 months a Labour govt will abolish the #bedroomtax, freeze energy prices, raise the min wage &amp; get young people back to work.
In contrast to no-show SNP MPs, every Scottish Labour MP was in the House of Commons voting to get rid of the #bedroomtax
Alex Salmond is conning people. He doesn't stand up for social justice. Today the majority of his MPs didn't turn up to the #bedroomtax vote
David Cameron‚Äôs defeat on the bedroom tax shows two things: the Tories are on the way out &amp; we can build social justice across the UK.
Incredible news. We've defeated the government on the cruel bedroom tax. This is a huge blow to David Cameron.
Voting now to reduce the number of people who pay the bedroom tax. Huge turnout from fellow Labour MPs who want to see it scrapped.
Today Labour MPs vote to reduce the number of people who pay the bedroom tax. And next May I'll scrap it altogether: http://t.co/yeOx04NXaF
The SNP are offering Tory policies - cutting taxes for corporations, cutting spending on schools &amp; hospitals.
SNP has a funny idea of social justice: 3p tax cut for corporations, keep the tax cut for millionaires, no energy price freeze.
A Labour govt in 8 months will:  freeze energy bills raise the min. wage introduce fairer taxes  tax bankers‚Äô bonuses  scrap the bedroom tax
My message on #gms: vote No on the 18th, and vote for a Labour govt in May to bring social justice and change to the whole of Britain.
What we have seen must strengthen not weaken our resolve to defeat ISIL. #PMQs
We've all been disgusted by the murder of Steven Sotloff. Our thoughts are with his family and those of the British hostage being held #PMQs
ISIL's cold-blooded brutality against the innocent offends the values of people throughout the world, wherever they live.
The killing by ISIL of another hostage and the threat of more violence demonstrates again their murderous barbarism.
Ashya King needs the love of his family and the best medical care. Hopefully latest developments mean he can be reunited with his parents.
Janice Turner interviewed me for @RedMagDaily about the urgent need to improve representation of women in government: http://t.co/tFvgStdW77

ISIL is a deep threat to our world but we need a diplomatic and political strategy to defeat them. http://t.co/5ttNsG3L7M

The report into child abuse in Rotherham was devastating. Here are my comments in the Doncaster Star: http://t.co/ytKRxvMwRn
ISIL is a deep threat and source of instability to our world. We can‚Äôt shrug our shoulders and hope it goes away: http://t.co/5ttNsG3L7M
Douglas Carswell‚Äôs defection is not just a blow to David Cameron. It shows the Tory Party too divided to stand up for hard-working families
The ceasefire in Gaza - agreed by both sides to end the bloodshed - and the commitment to further talks is a very welcome development.
Alistair Darling showed once again tonight that Alex Salmond has absolutely no answers on key questions around independence. #BetterTogether
The death of Richard Attenborough is a sad day for the film world and the Labour movement. He and his work will be remembered.
The killing of James Foley is an appalling act. We will support government both to find the perpetrators and combat the threat of ISIL
Scots have always been part of leading the UK. In one month they vote on whether to leave. I hope they say No and stay in the UK #LabourNo

Our message to Alex Salmond: If you care about social justice in our country, you can't leave the economics to guesswork.
On the most basic question of economics - Scotland's currency - the Yes campaign has no answer.

The number of working people who need housing benefit is set to double - a direct result of the Tory low-wage economy http://t.co/xRbctQSKKj
We‚Äôll cut the benefits bill with: A higher minimum wage Support for a living wage  200,000 new homes per year by 2020 http://t.co/6kzlK7UgTi
I‚Äôm proud of Labour‚Äôs record on devolution. That‚Äôs why I support more powers, guaranteed, for the Scottish Parliament.
David Cameron is right to condemn Hamas as a terrorist organisation but he needs to break his silence on Israel's indefensible actions.
I think Baroness Warsi has acted with principle &amp; integrity. People around Britain have been shocked by the suffering we have seen in Gaza.

If you use trains regularly you should read this: http://t.co/wn5rPdCLBt
Rail fares have gone up by 20% since 2010 - &amp; could go up by 5.6% next year. Labour would cap fare rises to take the pressure off commuters
I'm heading to Hastings for a Q&amp;A. On the Charing Cross train. Do you commute on this line? Fares could go up by up to ¬£260 next year.
Happy #YorkshireDay to my constituents &amp; everyone in Yorkshire. Proud to represent a great Yorkshire seat. #Donny

We have a housing crisis in Britain. Under David Cameron we're not building half the houses we need to meet demand http://t.co/KYbcn7k8Jv
We‚Äôve had four years of failure under David Cameron. Volunteer with Labour and help us stop him getting another five: http://t.co/7iihCFWfDg
By this time next year the election will have been fought and we‚Äôll have a new government. Make sure it‚Äôs Labour: http://t.co/7iihCFWfDg
We each face a choice next year. A country that works for a few, or a country - with Labour - that works for everyone http://t.co/hxHj0HeiHq
This is the choice on the NHS. A public, integrated NHS under Labour or a fragmented service under David Cameron: http://t.co/h8SRapelSE
My thoughts today are also with Muslims across the world who will be unable to celebrate Eid-Ul-Fitr this year.
I wish Muslims in Britain and around the world a happy Eid-Ul-Fitr #EidMubarak
We need a public question time, where the Prime Minister regularly submits himself or herself to questioning from the public.
I want more people to be more involved in politics.
Yes, David Cameron takes a good photo (and I don‚Äôt), but he can‚Äôt build a country that works for you: https://t.co/GMunIHo8lf
I‚Äôm not going to win on photo-ops. But I'll be a PM with big ideas who'll stick to my beliefs. I won‚Äôt abandon decency at the door to No10.
Later today, I'll be speaking about all of this... Follow @UKLabour from 12pm for updates. http://t.co/qO2C2syLTd

As soon as the investigation into the MH17 crash is completed we need an emergency meeting of European leaders to consider next steps.
European unity must not be an excuse for European inaction: we must tighten &amp; extend sanctions against Russia after the MH17 catastrophe.

Here‚Äôs my speech: http://t.co/QpkuQiIQel. Now we need to take this message out into the country &amp; win the election so we can change Britain.
I‚Äôm speaking to Labour‚Äôs National Policy Forum later. Britain faces big challenges ‚Äì I'm proud that we're making the policies to meet them.
It's vital that a full investigation is conducted into what caused the tragedy in Ukraine.
My deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of the nine Britons who were travelling on MH17.
Truly awful news about the Malaysian Airlines flight. My thoughts are with the victims, their families and friends.
The facts on the #bedroomtax are clear. The only government that will scrap it is a Labour government: http://t.co/Aer4imZl6a

Labour will build prosperity for all of Britain by enabling our great businesses to build wealth, create jobs and make profits.
The murder of Mohammed Abu Khdair in Jerusalem was an appalling act. This is a time for restraint on all sides.

Great to bring the Shadow Cabinet to GE in South Wales - a world leading manufacturer supported by the Welsh Labour Government.
The Labour government I lead will not make do and mend. Britain needs far reaching reform - big reform, not big spending.
We will switch spending from benefits to bricks by giving councils more power to save money and invest in new homes.
A @UKLabour government will ensure hard work is rewarded by restoring the principle of contribution to the heart of social security system.
A Labour government will get young people to sign up for training not sign on for benefits.

Those who work hard to create our nation‚Äôs wealth should share in it.  If you agree, add your name here: http://t.co/xcWM2aXcrs
Hard work should always pay a decent wage. So the Labour government I lead will strengthen the minimum wage to tackle low pay.
The National Minimum Wage is one of Labour's proudest achievements. It saved millions from poverty pay that shamed our country.

They were part of that great generation who risked their lives on D-Day to fight for the freedom we enjoy today. http://t.co/EgAgPOaqUF
Today I met a remarkable man. Mark Radley was just 19 when he served with my Dad on HMS Hilary during D-Day. http://t.co/EgAgPOaqUF
Very proud that @MichaelPayneUK is the @UKLabour candidate. He cares about his community and will work hard to protect local NHS services.
Good luck to all @UKLabour campaigners getting the vote out for @MichaelPayneUK in Newark today.
Thanks @CliveEfford for introducing me to Jenny, Christine, Lesley and Linda. All doing amazing work in Eltham. http://t.co/ZjvI1Bc6Hs
Tonight, I have the privilege of honouring some of our local communities‚Äô unsung heroes from headteachers to healthcare workers.
A Labour Queen‚Äôs Speech would introduce a Bill to stop NHS privatisation and make it easier for patients to see their GPs
A Labour Queen‚Äôs Speech would stand up for renters and be tough with developers with a Housing Bill to build 200k houses a year by 2020
Labour would freeze energy bills &amp; reform the energy market with a Consumers‚Äô Bill. The companies can afford it &amp; the British people need it
Labour would stop workers being undercut with an Immigration Bill that slows the pace of change but does not cut us off from the world
A Labour Queen‚Äôs Speech would create a Community Bill to take power from Whitehall and put it back in our great towns and cities
A Labour Queen‚Äôs Speech would have a Banking Bill to support small business, because the banks still need to change to serve our economy
For the first time, most of the people in poverty in Britain are people in work - we need to deal with that
A Labour Queen‚Äôs Speech would have a Make Work Pay Bill ‚Äì you should be able to make ends meet if you work all the hours God sends
We need a new direction for Britain to make this country work for all, and not just a few at the top. Today's speech did not give us that.
Disenchantment with politics goes beyond one party and one government. We cannot afford to ignore it.
More than at any time for generations, Parliament faces a battle for relevance and legitimacy in the eyes of the British people.
I'm in Parliament to hear the Queen's speech. It is David Cameron's last chance to tackle the challenges our country faces.
A Labour Queen‚Äôs Speech would include legislation to make work pay, reform our banks, freeze energy bills and build homes again in Britain.
Today‚Äôs Queen‚Äôs Speech should include a programme for government equal to the scale of the challenge our country faces.
David Cameron doesn't have a plan for families struggling with childcare. We do. RT if you're with us #forthemany http://t.co/UHxIkezuPL
If you‚Äôre a parent and you can spare 3 minutes to share your thoughts on childcare, I would love to hear from you: http://t.co/PED3Vkd5Ji
Childcare costs have risen five times faster than wages since 2010. Labour has a plan to help families struggling. http://t.co/2iy5x3xbTh
Are your children back at school this week? I want to hear what you think on childcare and how we can improve it: http://t.co/PED3Vkd5Ji
Nobody should be persecuted because of the religion they practice or the person they fall in love with.
The conviction and incarceration of Meriam Ibrahim is utterly appalling and an abhorrent abuse of her human rights.

Today I saw a brilliant One Nation Labour Party offering real change for Newark. Will you join them this weekend? https://t.co/P7o4c465JR
.@MichaelPayneUK has put Newark Hospital's future at the heart of his campaign - people here want a good local hospital they can rely on.
I've been meeting patients &amp; staff at Newark Hospital with Labour's by-election candidate @MichaelPayneUK http://t.co/Mk1kYVQI5E
We have work to do to reach out to millions. But that‚Äôs what I am determined to do. Will you join me? http://t.co/OCuTiC2AvR
I want to lead a party that brings people together, from all walks of life, all backgrounds &amp; all classes. That‚Äôs what I mean by One Nation.
To meet the challenges we face we need more change, not less, to create the wealth of the future with decent jobs and wages.
I have changed Labour‚Äôs position on immigration. But I won‚Äôt make false promises, or cut ourselves off from the rest of the world.
If you work hard to support your family and build a better future, you shouldn‚Äôt be left behind. You certainly shouldn‚Äôt be ignored.
Millions feel our country doesn‚Äôt work for them, that politics isn‚Äôt listening and cannot answer them. It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way.
The last Labour government was right to be open to the world but there is no future in saying we can pick up from where we left off in 2010
To understand these elections we can‚Äôt just look at the last few weeks or the last three years but much further back: the last three decades
I'm in Thurrock - right next to the Dartford crossing - talking about Britain's future &amp; the lessons we need to take from these elections
If you share my values of hard work, fairness and opportunity then help show that we can make Britain work again: http://t.co/EKthMQuN8o
Over the next year, I'm determined to show that @UKLabour can bring the change this country desperately needs.
There is a deep sense of discontent with the way this country is run and the way our economy works.
But last night‚Äôs results also reflect a desire for Europe to work better for Britain and deep discontent within our country.
We made real progress in the Euro elections. We‚Äôve elected 20 @UKLabour MEPs and beat the Tories.
Where we now have majorities, Labour-run councils will make a real difference to the lives of the people they serve #forthemany‚Äã
Thank you to everyone who has campaigned to elect hundreds of Labour councillors today.
I am determined that Labour shows you over the next 12 months how we can change your lives for the better http://t.co/yaQkErgef2
Congratulations to Labour in Crawley - another #labourgain today. Over the next year they‚Äôll show that we can deliver the change people want
Great news from Amber Valley. Now Labour-run after for the first time in 14 years. Congratulations to the whole team there
Also congratulations to the @UKLabour teams in Redbridge and Cambridge. We‚Äôre showing we can win in key battleground seats for 2015.‚Äã
Congratulations (&amp; early #ff) to @StephenCowan, the new Leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council
There is a deep discontent with the way the country is run and a deep desire to change.
Across the country people have voted Labour to make change happen. I'm determined we persuade people we can improve their lives.
Today, we campaigned for a Britain where hardworking people are better  off. Tomorrow the campaign begins to win that same fight in May 2015
Thank you to every Labour supporter out campaigning today (especially those who got soaked!)
Labour will make the long-term changes we need to tackle youth unemployment &amp; give young people the chance to get on http://t.co/VRAI21ZM88
RT this &amp; back Labour's plan to end exploitation of migrant workers &amp; create an economy that works for working people http://t.co/ffcCDqTpGh
RT this: Labour will help families with 25 hours free childcare a week for three- and four-year-olds. http://t.co/jSvfrRr6wM
Business rates are costing small firms ¬£1700 more. Labour will cut &amp; freeze rates and help 80,000 businesses http://t.co/MAiHojo7sW
We believe that people who work hard should get decent pay. Vote Labour today because we'll fight for a living wage. http://t.co/pfcGuN3Oam
Too many people are left stressed and out-of-pocket because of zero-hours contracts. Labour will fix that: http://t.co/rgVmRLj6Q4
The Tories have given millionaires a tax cut. Labour would give millions of people a tax cut with a 10p starting rate http://t.co/bdqLe8Jh6m
Labour will stand up for renters by banning rip-off letting agents' fees and making longer term tenancies the norm http://t.co/4buPE3S2Ka

Thank you to all the supporters campaigning for a Labour win today. Your work means so much to me, but means even more to a better Britain.
I've just voted in Doncaster. Make sure you get out to vote &amp; have your voice heard. Polls are open until 10pm. http://t.co/Yj73bbU0Oc
Polls are now open. There are loads of reasons to vote Labour today, ten are here - http://t.co/awuoOsOIkl. Have a look before you vote.
It‚Äôs been a busy day on the road today. Here‚Äôs a look back on everyone I met and the conversations I‚Äôve had: https://t.co/9sqySCyiXn
Today I met Louise &amp; Chris, a really loving, happy couple. Their story was disheartening but we can do something: http://t.co/3jCa53D4Kb
I‚Äôve met some inspiring people while campaigning today. Tomorrow we have a chance to vote for a better Britain: http://t.co/tk7ClORISk
I spent the final day of the campaign on the road meeting voters. Take a look at what that looks like: https://t.co/9sqySCyiXn
I'm finishing the day door knocking in my constituency in Doncaster. Before you vote tomorrow, read this: http://t.co/vrnAp3NOzV
Rent is just one of the many cost of living issues I've been talking about with people around the country today: http://t.co/rsOwpYT7Qu
‚ÄúI have 2 jobs &amp; a good salary but because so much of my income is eaten by rent &amp; deposits are so high, I‚Äôll never own a home‚Äù - Stephanie
9th visit of the day done: talking to workers at Tesco in Hucknall about Labour's plan to cut income tax for 24 million people.
‚ÄúWe worry about every July because of the inevitable rent increase. It's a constant feeling of insecurity &amp; stress for our family‚Äù - Kathryn
‚ÄúWe fear reporting issues in case the landlord evicts us, but feel trapped as deposits/fees make it so expensive to move again‚Äù - Amina
‚ÄúAs a working single mother, finding a flat I could afford was very difficult. I have no extra income at the end of the month‚Äù - Cat
I'm spending my journey to Doncaster reading your renting stories. They are so powerful that I wanted to share a few.
Today I‚Äôve been talking to people who rent their homes. I asked for your experiences of renting too, and hundreds of you responded.
Labour will get 200,000 houses a year built by 2020. Labour-run Lincoln City Council is shows us how it can be done: http://t.co/R0vqyPmTn9
We are suffering the biggest housing crisis in a generation with house building at the lowest level since the 1920s
The difference a Labour council makes: I just visited Lincoln's first council-built social housing in 20 years.
Want to follow what I‚Äôm up to on the final day of the campaign? Take a look at this: http://t.co/rsOwpYT7Qu
"Energy bills keep changing and going up" - Maryam, Bedford. Labour will freeze gas &amp; electricity bills to 2017: http://t.co/00QYUzM6Ju
If you can spare a minute, I‚Äôd be really interested to know about your experiences of renting a home: http://t.co/aEhOhUNhTg
Labour will expand free childcare to 25 hours a week for three- and four-year-olds to help parents balance working &amp; being with the family.
Childcare costs have risen by 30 percent since 2010 - five times faster than wages - but the government doesn't have a plan to help.
I just left a children's centre where I talked to Charlotte about Labour's plans on childcare. Here's what she said: http://t.co/vtJqmnMYKy
My day on the campaign trail: ten stops, ten pledges. Here‚Äôs a map to help you follow along: http://t.co/rsOwpYT7Qu
I just spoke to Laura about her apprenticeship with @CharlesWellsLtd. Here's what she told me: http://t.co/jSQiYE0h2F
Labour will create more high quality apprenticeships focused on young people entering the jobs market.
Labour will guarantee every young person out of work for more than 12 months a paid starter job.
We need to make big long term changes to training and education so that young people have the chance to get on.
Under David Cameron hundreds of thousands of young people are unemployed - the Tories are failing a generation.
I met the @openuniversity's Vice-Chancellor Martin Bean earlier. He told me why they decided to pay the living wage: http://t.co/JHruqsXPWN
Now I'm heading to Wells and Young Brewery to talk to some young apprentices about the training they're getting.
Labour will make big changes to the minimum wage - making sure that all workers get decent pay for a hard day's work.
We'll introduce 'Make Work Pay' contracts to encourage more employers to pay the living wage - companies that sign up will get a tax rebate
Low pay is a huge problem for millions. David Cameron is doing nothing to tackle it. Over five million people earn less than the living wage
It's been really good to be here at the @openuniversity campus in Milton Keynes to hear about their commitment to the living wage.
@piratetreasures I'm sorry to hear your daughter is affected. We need to get building houses again in this country. Please pass on my best.
@alyinwonderland We want to give people certainty about rent so longer-term contracts will be the norm. We're looking at buy-to-leave too.
Labour will stand up for renters - we'll ban rip-off letting agents' fees and make longer term tenancies with predictable rents the norm.
Since 2010 rents have increased more than twice as fast as wages, and people who rent face upfront fees of up to ¬£500.
I'm on my way to Milton Keynes to talk to people about the cost of renting going through the roof. Is the cost of renting affecting you?
My second visit of the day - and my third cup of tea. I'm here to talk with people on zero-hours contracts. http://t.co/jN1prIFNxP
Business owners like Savas and Irem are struggling - our business rate cut will help them: http://t.co/30rHcyGjJM
I was at New Covent Garden flower market early this morning talking to business owners about Labour's plans to cut &amp; freeze business rates
These are our ten pledges to help you with the cost of living: http://t.co/awuoOsOIkl http://t.co/wXEdX92rK5 http://t.co/pDj1lwuZz8
Polls open in 24 hours - I'm visiting 10 different places to talk about the 10 pledges in our cost-of-living contract http://t.co/awuoOsOIkl
To every fantastic @UKLabour volunteer - here are ten pledges you can take out on the doorstep in the next two days: http://t.co/awuoOsOIkl
Tomorrow I'll be travelling around the country for the final day of the election. Ten visits, ten reasons to vote Labour on Thursday.
Over the last few weeks we have shown the difference Labour can make where it matters: on housing, on the NHS, on wages, on immigration.
Rachael works hard but she's struggling to make ends meet. Labour will make sure people like Rachael get decent pay: http://t.co/Jscac0IWsU
Under David Cameron: 13,000 millionaires got a tax cut 60,000 carers are hit by the bedroom tax Help me change that: http://t.co/uSQ5e8ALrQ 
I'm on @GMB at 7:20am talking about some of the ways Labour will help families with the cost-of-living crisis. http://t.co/Sf1cLatPfL
I think a hard day's work should mean a decent day's pay. If you agree sign this: http://t.co/WuKDXv8ejA
Labour will make biggest change to the National Minimum Wage since we introduced it. But we need your help to do it: http://t.co/WuKDXv8ejA
If you do a hard day‚Äôs work you shouldn‚Äôt find yourself in poverty. Sign this if you agree: http://t.co/WuKDXv8ejA
Thank you to every @UKLabour supporter who was out campaigning this weekend. We knocked on 157,000 doors on Saturday alone. Amazing work.
Talk to friends and people at work about what Labour will do: give every hardworking family a share in the wealth they help to create.
This week we can begin to bring change by electing Labour MEPs to fight in Europe for working people and electing Labour councils. -Ed
There is no future for Britain competing on the basis of low pay with the sweat-shops of the world. -Ed
We will set a target for the next Parliament designed to move the National Minimum Wage closer to average earnings by 2020. -Ed
Today, I am proud to announce that the next Labour government will take new radical action against low pay. -Ed
As a basic principle we should aspire to a situation where if you do a hard day‚Äôs work you shouldn‚Äôt find yourself in poverty. - Ed
Over five million people are low paid in Britain today. 1 in 3 women in work, 40% of young people. It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. ‚Äì Ed
The Tories said the minimum wage would destroy millions of jobs. It didn‚Äôt. - Ed
There is a low pay epidemic in this country. The Tories don‚Äôt get it, but we do. -Ed
Today, we‚Äôre setting out more answers: the biggest change to the National Minimum Wage since it was introduced 15 years ago. -Ed
Labour has been setting out the answers, on zero hours contracts, rip off letting agent fees, a right to see a GP within 48 hours. -Ed
UKIP don‚Äôt have the answers. Keeping the flame of Thatcherism alive is not going to make our country work for working people. -Ed
The Tories don‚Äôt get it, they really believe everything is fixed. They just don‚Äôt get the problem. - Ed
Big question in this election is whether we can get our country to work again for most hardworking people &amp; not just a few at the top. - Ed
I‚Äôm in Walsall to talk about what Labour will do to give everyone a decent day's pay. A member of my team will tweet while I speak...
Under Labour workers on the minimum wage will not be left behind - hard work should mean decent pay.
Britain is one of the lowest paid advanced economies. Labour will restore the link between hard work &amp; decent pay for working people.
Thousands are out campaigning for Labour candidates &amp; Labour values to win on Thursday - will you join our team? http://t.co/hqTfMmJxOu
We're knocking on 100,000 doors this weekend to tell people that a vote on Thursday for @UKLabour is a vote #forthemany
Have written to Narendra Modi to congratulate him on his victory and pledge Labour's commitment to strengthening our relationship with India
I'm on with @MurnaghanSky at 11am on @SkyNews . If you're still unsure how to vote on Thursday, watch it.
Really wonderful looking at all the #LabourDoorstep photos on Twitter today. We have a great and vibrant movement.  #forthemany‚Äã
Crawley's youngest campaigner stealing the limelight from me, @AnnelieseDodds &amp; @chrisoxlade http://t.co/tIg0TRf3Ae http://t.co/htAGVSQR8U
I'm really proud to be campaigning alongside @UKLabour members and supporters across the country today #LabourDoorstep #forthemany
Labour will build a better Britain for you and your family. This is how we'll start: http://t.co/awuoOsOIkl #forthemany
These elections are about the millions of people across our country whose voices the Tories will never hear - Ed
Labour will scrap the Tories' terrible Health and Social Care Act - Ed
Labour will put the right principles back at the heart of our public services. An NHS based on co-operation, care &amp; compassion - Ed
Labour will restore the promise that the next generation can do better than the last - Ed
Labour will build a country that works for all and not just a few at the top - Ed
This is what UKIP really offer: "Keeping the flame of Thatcherism alive‚Äù. Bigger cuts than the Tories. Charges to see your GP - Ed
The Tories say Britain can‚Äôt do better than this, that this is as good as it gets. They're wrong - Ed
If you worry about the cost of living, the life you can build for your kids, about the NHS: Labour is on your side - Ed
I'm in Crawley to kick off the last five days of our local &amp; European election campaign. A member of my team will tweet while I speak...
We need to do more to champion high-wage, high-skill jobs - like at Airbus. That's how we build a better future for working people.
I want an economy that works for working people - we've become too dependent on low-skill, low-wage migrant labour.
I gave a speech today at Airbus on how Labour's changed on immigration. http://t.co/s3epPuHncW
Until then: Here are ten ways Labour is going to help you and your family: http://t.co/awuoOsOIkl
Later I'm meeting Airbus workers in North Wales to talk about jobs, Britain's role in Europe and how Labour has changed on immigration.
The biggest issue facing our country is how we restore the link between work &amp; the chance of building a decent life for you &amp; your family
We can't get the right solutions to the problems in our NHS without going to see what's really going on. So I did: https://t.co/gIlFDsq4Tg
If you missed my interview with @theJeremyVine on how Labour will improve social care you can listen here: http://t.co/hIGkpXbyXD
If you missed our new NHS film on tv last night here's the 15 second version: http://t.co/sCvJtid2QY
Labour councils are already finding ways to improve social care - the next Labour government would make it a national priority.
Carers do incredibly important work- yet they aren't given the time they need to do their job and hundreds of thousands are on low wages.
I was just on @BBCRadio2 with @thejeremyvine - talking about how we can improve the quality of social care. http://t.co/VrGatZDNZh
At my NHS speech on Monday I was asked what Labour would do to improve the quality of care. This is the first step: http://t.co/PnSclrfQvt
David Axelrod has joined me at Shadow Cabinet to discuss how we win and change Britain. http://t.co/GvrYIPZ46Y
At #PMQs David Cameron was unable to answer any questions on the future of research and jobs from the Pfizer deal.
David Cameron is cheerleading for Pfizer‚Äôs bid rather than championing British science and industry. #PMQs
Tragic news that Stephen Sutton has passed away. His bravery &amp; determination to live life to the full was an inspiration to us all.
Last night Tories &amp; Lib Dems voted against banning rip off letting agents' fees. A govt I led would stand up for renters &amp; ban rip-off fees.
My vision for our NHS: Care, co-operation &amp; compassion. Not privatisation &amp; competition. Watch: http://t.co/AP3pjBGjtl
I dread to think what five more years of the Tories would mean for the NHS. I promise to lead it to a better future http://t.co/6hjjMNC6JT
I want to get on and improve the NHS and make sure it‚Äôs still there when our kids need it: http://t.co/wks7ytEBHR
Tories &amp; Lib Dems combined to stop our ban on rip-off letting fees for tenants. A Labour government will scrap them: http://t.co/NkhELSRxLn
I just voted to help nine million renters with the cost of living by banning rip-off letting fees.
Generation rent needs proper protection against being ripped off. Today Labour MPs will vote to give them a hand and ban letting agent fees.
Last month, I spent two days in a hospital seeing the amazing work done by our NHS. Watch my film: https://t.co/R7q9NzK99V
If you missed it yesterday: Here's a look back at my NHS speech and our GP guarantee: http://t.co/e9TEY10QPT
Stories like this make me even more determined to bring in a GP guarantee if Labour wins the election next year. We've got to fix this.
"I couldn't get an appointment at my GP last year &amp; was told to wait until the following day. I ended up needing emergency surgery."
"It's impossible to get (GP) appointments to fit in with work responsibilities."
"We have to wait 8 days to get an appointment now compared to pre-2010 when we got a same day appointment. It's not right."
"I waited so long for a GP appointment that my mental health issues got worse. Now, I need more treatment than I would have needed.‚Äù
I'm on the train back to London. I've been reading some of the responses to our GP waiting times poll (take it here: http://t.co/6m26VvhE6k)
If you have a second, let me know if you'd had a tough time getting a GP appointment: http://t.co/C1G2TZBnae
Told @BBCBreakfast &amp; @BBC5Live that Labour will guarantee everyone can see a GP in 48 hours. The Tories don't trust doctors to deliver this.
Speech done, one more thought before the end of the day: The NHS is one of the greatest things our country has ever done. We must protect it
Ed: Britain loves the NHS, Britain needs the NHS, and working together we can protect and improve the NHS for the future.
Ed: Labour will have the right priorities: - Co-operation not privatisation - Patients before profit That‚Äôs what makes the NHS what it is.
Ed: The Tories say if it worked for the privatised utilities why shouldn‚Äôt it work for the NHS? That says it all. Not under my government.
Ed: We need to end David Cameron‚Äôs dogmatic obsession with bringing competition and privatisation into the heart of the NHS.
Ed: As well as same-day consultation, we'll guarantee a same-day GP appointment if you need it &amp; that everyone can see a GP within 48 hours.
Ed: Today I can announce that the next Labour government will guarantee a same-day consultation with your GP surgery.
Ed: In 2010, the vast majority of patients could see their GP within 48 hours. Today only 40% of people get an appointment within 48 hours.
Ed: David Cameron has proved the oldest truth in British politics: you can‚Äôt trust the Tories with our NHS.
Ed: The NHS staff and patients I recently met in Watford had something in common. They all know these are hard times again for the NHS.
Ed: I recently spent two nights with staff &amp; patients at Watford‚Äôs NHS hospital. Every patient I met had such belief &amp; pride in our NHS.
I‚Äôm in Manchester to talk about our plans for a stronger, better NHS. A member of my team is going to tweet while I speak, stay tuned...
Aneira was the first baby born under the NHS. In her lifetime she's seen the Tories try to wreck it &amp; Labour save it: http://t.co/lkqCZAJ9dt
In the last 12 months almost a million people waited more than four hours to be seen at Accident and Emergency.
On David Cameron's watch we've had a chaotic &amp; expensive reorganisation of the NHS that no one wanted &amp; which he promised wouldn't happen.
The nurses &amp; physios I spoke to want to do their jobs &amp; provide the best care for their patients, but that's getting harder under the Tories
I've spent the morning at Leighton Hospital in Crewe talking to staff &amp; patients about our NHS http://t.co/0ZFt9konwf
Apart from banning exploitative zero-hour contracts, here are nine other things a Labour government will do: http://t.co/ZHLUJS7s3L
A passenger was walking through the train &amp; stopped to ask me what we're going to do about exploitative zero-hour contracts: we'll ban them.
I'm heading to Crewe this morning for a hospital visit. But first, I want to recount a conversation I had on the train from Euston.
John's unshakable commitment to public service was rooted in his Labour values &amp; deep desire to improve the lives of people across the UK.
Twenty years ago today, the Labour Leader John Smith - a man of great decency &amp; deep integrity - sadly passed away. http://t.co/t0cJtH2EAa
We have a national crisis in primary school places and it's of the government's making: http://t.co/ySLO3XNRG5
29 years ago today, 56 people tragically died in the Bradford City Fire. My thoughts are with the family &amp; friends of all the victims.
I'm campaigning in Leeds taking questions with @hilarybennmp http://t.co/16FsvIwYvP
Good to meet Mr &amp; Mrs Meek campaigning in Askern with our excellent Labour councillor and candidate Iris Beech http://t.co/jApAEiZBqR
Labour would get 200,000 houses a year built and tackle low pay with make work pay contracts: http://t.co/ZHLUJS7s3L
There's been a 60% rise in working people claiming housing benefit since 2010. David Cameron is falling people on housing and decent pay.
If you're in Newcastle anytime soon go to Grainger Market, it's lovely here. Why did I get lunch on the train? http://t.co/aRa721rP8m
I'm on the beautiful train journey from Edinburgh to Newcastle. It's tough to beat this view. http://t.co/EyeAYDkblC
With Scotland in the UK and a Labour government next May we can deliver real change on jobs, housing, low pay and the cost-of-living.
Our new Scotland Act would mean more powers for the Scottish parliament over income tax, housing benefit and the work programme.
I'm in Dundee to launch Labour's contract with the people of Scotland - including a new Scotland Act in our first Queen's Speech.
I've just been to Michelin in Dundee. High-tech quality jobs &amp; a great apprenticeship programme (so say Kris &amp; Craig) http://t.co/X6OgP05Kdz
‚ÄúWe made the decision not to have a second child as a result of the cost of childcare.‚Äù -- Anne, Richmond
"I returned to work when my daughter was 7 months old. By Friday, I‚Äôm out of pocket by ¬£30. It‚Äôs not worth me working‚Äù -- Louise, Liverpool
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a nurse working permanent night duty so we can keep childcare costs down. Our family time is suffering.‚Äù -- Zoe, Manchester
"Both myself and my partner work part-time. We‚Äôre better off by working less just to keep childcare costs down.‚Äù -- Danny, Norfolk
Earlier I asked you to share your childcare stories with me - hundreds of you did. Here are a few I felt needed sharing...
When I was young I lived in Horsforth. It's good to be back here supporting Pudsey candidate @jamiehanley http://t.co/FgPmRjeykm
Childcare costs have risen 5 times faster than wages here in Dewsbury. Here's what Labour will do to help with that: http://t.co/PQjn26auFp

Are you struggling with the cost of childcare? Take this one minute survey and let me know: http://t.co/Lz0qBXHA8m
I was in Salford Quays to do a few TV interviews &amp; talk about how the cost-of-living crisis is hurting families - especially childcare costs
I just bumped into Sue, Catherine, Lynda and Carole having lunch in Salford Quays. (Thanks for sharing your chips) http://t.co/NcJ8aBe0Sc
@MazHappy Hi Marion - we'd start by making sure 3&amp;4 yr olds of working parents get 25 hours of free childcare a week
@Aubreii Sorry to hear that Shaun - I know it's tough to make ends meet. We'd extend free child care hours for 3&amp;4yr olds.
The main issue raised at Burnage Children's Centre: mums and dads struggling to balance childcare costs and work. http://t.co/zeS7ep8xXO
Our cost-of-living contract shows the immediate steps we'd take to help families struggling to make ends meet: http://t.co/ZHLUJS7s3L
Working people have seen their wages fall by ¬£1,600 since 2010.
Renting is getting more expensive, which hits 1.3 million families with children.
And childcare is in shorter supply: there are 578 fewer Sure Start centres &amp; 35,000 fewer childcare places now than in 2010.
Childcare is getting more expensive: costs have risen by 30 per cent since 2010 - five times faster than wages.
Here's why we think families with children need more support:
I'm meeting parents today for a simple reason: families with children have been hit hardest of all by David Cameron's cost-of-living crisis
On the train to Stockport to visit a Sure Start centre. I'm going to talk to parents there about what Labour would do to make life easier.
9 million renters need a government that will stand up for them. With Labour, that‚Äôs exactly what they‚Äôll get. http://t.co/UQYh3MEuEJ
If we win the election a year from today, we'll ban rip-off letting agent fees. To win, we need you: http://t.co/CnoOdmexSL
This week I met Mhairi. She wants stable rent so she can save up to buy a house. Instead the PM is abandoning generation rent.
At #PMQs David Cameron refused to act on rents. Tories have abandoned Generation Rent.
The Prime Minister is cheerleading for Pfizer‚Äôs bid for AstraZeneca rather than championing British science and industry. #PMQs
What we do in the next year will determine the future of Britain for generations. I want you on our campaign: http://t.co/CnoOdmexSL

I'm really proud to launch London Labour‚Äôs campaign for local and European elections with a plan to help families get a home of their own.
Just launched London Labour's local and European election campaign with candidates and supporters in Croydon. http://t.co/c7V2sqkp1H
Mhairi: 'we want to buy, in fact we can afford a mortgage, but renting costs make it difficult to save. Longer tenancy would help us plan.'
Mhairi's story is familiar: can afford a mortgage, but high cost of renting makes buying impossible.
Heading to Croydon for London campaign launch. But first time for a cup of tea with Mhairi in Streatham. http://t.co/t4YBm3ggKR
Terribly sad news about Elena Baltacha. My thoughts are with her family and friends at this incredibly difficult time.
As Prime Minister I'd make sure takeovers like proposed AstraZeneca bid are in the national interest: http://t.co/8qPr6eZr0L
Our science/R&amp;D base is key in winning a race to the top. The PM must publish a proper assessment of Pfizer bid http://t.co/3ybTUj046Y
Instead of cheerleading for Pfizer's takeover, David Cameron should be standing up for our national economic interest http://t.co/3ybTUj046Y
Appearing on the @MarrShow this morning to talk about local &amp; European elections. Will also comment on AstraZeneca takeover.

Our choice: tackle the cost-of-living crisis or accept an economy that only works for a privileged few: http://t.co/awuoOsOIkl
Here are ten concrete steps I will take as Prime Minister to deal with the cost-of-living crisis: http://t.co/awuoOsOIkl
9 million people are renting today ‚Äì many want more security &amp; stability. @UKLabour will make sure they get it.
A Labour government will make sure renters get a fair deal: we'll make long-term tenancies the norm and ban letting agents fees for tenants.
On average renters are made to pay ¬£350 by letting agents just to move home. A Labour government will stop that.
Good to discuss Labour's plan to address challenges faced by generation rent with @rupahuq yesterday in West London http://t.co/4r8AgcXB2z
A national asset, sold at a knock-down price, and a sweetheart deal for the city. #pmqs
The more we know about David Cameron's privatisation of Royal Mail the bigger the fiasco it is. #pmqs
Tomorrow One Nation Labour will offer action on wages, jobs &amp; prices to help make hardworking Britain better off http://t.co/iSGVE9l3HR
Nigel Farage's policies towards working people are more Thatcherite than Lady Thatcher herself. http://t.co/iSGVE9l3HR
The killing of Anne Maguire was an appalling act. My thoughts are with her family, the school and those pupils who witnessed the attack
People across the UK will be saddened by the awful news from Afghanistan. My thoughts are with the families &amp; friends of those killed.
We will ban worst abuses of zero hours contracts so workers get a fair deal for a fair day's work and we get social justice across the UK
Great to be in Glasgow where I will chair Labour's Shadow Cabinet and make the case for social justice across the UK.
Happy St George's Day to everyone across England celebrating today.
Happy Easter to Christians in the UK and across the world: http://t.co/DCLkkLXb4f

A week on, a minister‚Äôs resigned and still the Prime Minister doesn‚Äôt seem to understand what Maria Miller did wrong.
Maria Miller overclaimed expenses, refused to cooperate with the inquiry, and breached the code of conduct for MPs.
The Prime Minister is the last person in the country to work out that Maria Miller‚Äôs position was untenable. He just doesn‚Äôt get it.
The Tories think that insecure, low-paid, low-skilled jobs answer the cost-of-living crisis. Here's why they don't: http://t.co/uYLzECOgZD
Devolving power from Whitehall to our towns and cities is essential to generate the new jobs we need: http://t.co/uYLzECOgZD
Labour will help businesses create the middle-income jobs that are crucial to overcoming this cost-of-living crisis: http://t.co/uYLzECOgZD
To our cities, towns &amp; businesses I say: work together &amp; you'll get historic new powers to drive economic development http://t.co/uYLzECOgZD
We need a prosperous London. But we need to build prosperity outside it too. See my speech this morning: http://t.co/uYLzECOgZD

Too many victims of crime have too little faith in our criminal justice system. Labour will change that: http://t.co/Jofbx5MIWc
If Britain stays in this race to the bottom, the cost-of-living crisis will continue for the next Parliament too. http://t.co/ewvC0NuPnz
We have a cost-of-living crisis because the link between growth &amp; family finances of middle Britain has been broken. http://t.co/ewvC0NuPnz

I was proud to speak at Tony Benn‚Äôs funeral earlier. His family spoke so warmly about their love for him.
Today's announcement shows that the energy market is broken. That's why the next Labour govt will freeze energy bills until 2017.
An energy price freeze for households &amp; businesses is feasible, workable &amp; it will happen under a Labour government. #PMQs

It doesn't matter if the pound is square, round or oval. If you're ¬£1,600 worse off, you're ¬£1,600 worse off. #Budget2014
This is a budget that shows people are worse off under the Tories. A worse off budget, from an out of touch Chancellor. #Budget2014
Top priority for the budget must be tackling the cost-of-living crisis that millions of families are facing. http://t.co/QJ0iLFqhfX
Today we‚Äôll see a Tory budget that claims our economy is fixed while families are ¬£1600 a year worse off. http://t.co/oWCFoBIJkd
Today @ScottishLabour announces proposals for further devolution which will bring people and power closer. http://t.co/XGRTbZv4Ym
Labour has always been the party of devolution, not independence. In 2015 Labour will extend Scotland‚Äôs devolved powers.
Only One Nation Labour will build the high wage, high skill economy that can power us forward. http://t.co/iJXzk1whRR
A recovery for the few is not an accident of this government‚Äôs economic policy ‚Äì it is their economic policy. http://t.co/iJXzk1whRR
Key Budget question is: will there be a recovery which will help millions of hardworking families ‚Äì or just a few? http://t.co/iJXzk1whRR

Tony Benn was a champion of the powerless, a great Parliamentarian and a conviction politician.  My deep condolences go to his family.
Today, I'll be explaining why Britain's future lies in a reformed European Union and how Labour will protect the national interest.
Today I'll be unveiling details of Labour's new lock: no transfer of powers to the EU without an in/out referendum.
You can't trust the Tories on Europe. They're divided and they will damage our national interest.
My priorities for govt are the cost-of-living crisis, the NHS &amp; creating jobs for young people. Not a damaging debate about leaving the EU.
The next Labour government will work to make Europe work better for Britain. http://t.co/L5n2Etp2dc
The next Labour govt will legislate for a new lock: no transfer of powers to the EU without an in/out referendum. http://t.co/L5n2Etp2dc

I welcome the support David Owen is giving Labour. We are reaching out to become a truly One Nation party.
