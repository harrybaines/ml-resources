@APFaz The majority did not vote for a hard Brexit and to make the country poorer - why should the Eurosceptic fanatics dictate the shape of the final settlement by calling anyone who disagrees with their hardline interpretation a traitor?

We need laws and employment protections for the 21st Century labour market and its exploitations of fragmented contracts, zero hours contracts, agency work and apparent self employment which shifts all the risks into individuals and let‚Äôs bad employers off the hook https://t.co/epauxJRmcL
All good things we should be proud of - but we did not ensure that new forms of labour market exploitation were identified and tackled as they appeared. https://t.co/CJfcQN0zno
She‚Äôs trying to spread the blame for this debacle everywhere but where it really lays - at the PMs own front door - https://t.co/IgWC7y2G4a
We should have gone further The right to recognition was not nearly effective enough and we should have cracked down on union busting. Stronger employment rights &amp; better enforcement also important https://t.co/l12ow6Yd90
