The House of Commons has, in effect, just expressed its lack of confidence in the Prime Minister’s Brexit strategy. She has no majority, no plan, no deal and no alternative but to seek an extension to Article 50. https://t.co/P6ExQblkRI
What’s really evident about today’s Brexit debate is that it’s actually a negotiation between the Brexit Secretary and the ERG about whether they will support the Government motion rather than a negotiation about what’s best for the national interest.

@Chris_Leigh_UK I did in our meetings in Brussels last Monday. You are right that it would need a change of approach by both the EU and the UK, but I think it’s a much more sensible way of proceeding given the current deadlock.
@Iamspartacus73 Extend Article 50 to allow time to negotiate the future partnership. This would mean we could park the Withdrawal Agreement for the moment. When the process is complete then we’d all be able to see what Brexit means and what our future relationship would look like.
The basic problem with where we are on Brexit is that we have absolutely no idea what our future relationship with the EU will look like because we haven’t even started negotiating it yet.  It’s like moving out of your own home before you’ve found somewhere else to live.
As each day passes, we learn just how irresponsible were the claims that it would be easy to roll over these EU trade deals as we leave. https://t.co/pUMjNrHIx5

@nigrugthug @CommonsEUexit I hope you’ve told all those people  in the UK who are hoping to buy a car made in the EU after 29th March that in the event of a no deal Brexit you want to increase the price by 50%.
2/2 If they arrive after a no deal Brexit on 29 March, what tariff will they have to pay and what customs declarations will they need? Just asking for everyone in the UK who makes cars for a living.
1/2 In a couple of weeks’ time, cars made in Britain will be loaded into containers to be shipped to the Far East where, at the moment, they are sold under one of the EU’s free trade agreements. A question ?
@teggly https://t.co/JcqggFeRq0
We are likely to see more announcements by firms of operations moving out of the UK, particularly if we don’t stop a no deal Brexit. This is what uncertainty about our future relationship with the EU is doing to the future of our economy and the jobs it sustains.
@DinnersHK Indeed.  And that’s what the future partnership negotiations will reveal - so let’s get on with them.

4/4 What we actually need is for the Government to start listening on the changes that need to be made to the political declaration which deals with the most important question – namely our future relationship with the European Union.
3/4 It is therefore hard to avoid the conclusion that the Prime Minister had decided to go through the same process all over for reasons of party management rather than in the national interest.
2/4 The problem then was that these ideas didn’t go anywhere because the technology doesn’t exist, the EU described the plans as magical thinking and the Prime Minister ended up rejecting them.
1/4 Listening to what the Prime Minister said today about the alternative arrangements she wants for the backstop is a re-run of last summer when the Cabinet discussed technology, trusted traders and the maximum facilitation proposal as a way of solving the NI border problem
@martinjhamer . It is indeed a private member’s bill -ie not a government bill – which is supporting Labour policy.
The House of Commons has just rejected a no deal Brexit. The Prime Minister must now respect the clear will of the House.
@Colin00007 .  It’s one thing to hold a different view. It’s quite another to invent facts. Turnout in Leeds was 69.60%, with 50.3% voting to Remain.

@bencorke . 1/2 This is what the Brexit Secretary told the House of Commons last Thursday in answer to a question on exactly this issue: “Article XXIV allows only interim arrangements that are necessary for the formulation of a new free trade area where the parties have.... “
@bobirving_green @CommonsEUexit It would be disastrous to leave with no deal. I don’t think there’s a majority for it in the House of Commons so let’s find out for sure.
3/3 The PM says she is “talking and listening to people about what would secure the support of this House”.  Well there’s a very simple way of trying to find the answer to that question. Let MPs vote on the different options.
2/3 The six options the @CommonsEUexit has identified are:  1. Hold another vote on the PM’s deal. 2. Leave with no deal.  3. Renegotiate the current deal.   4. Negotiate a Canada-style deal.  5. Negotiate a Norway-style deal with a customs union. 6. Hold a second referendum.
1/3 Here’s the case for holding a series of indicative votes on Brexit. Parliament is currently deadlocked. MPs voted down the PM’s deal but haven’t yet agreed on an alternative, so why not see if there is a different approach that can command a majority?

2/2 This is what the Trade Minister George Hollingberry told me just now in the House of Commons when I asked him how many of these deals have been signed as of today: “ There are no deals that have yet been actually signed.“  Unbelievable !

@SAForster @SouthLeedsLife @iainjwatson @UKLabour Yes. The  Brexit Select Committee that I chair has produced many detailed reports and recommendations.
@iainjwatson @UKLabour Following her catastrophic defeat last night, the Prime Minister cannot claim to be reaching out to MPs while insisting that none of her red lines will change. If she rings anyone on that basis then it’ll be a very short phone call.
The Prime Minister’s Brexit Agreement has been defeated by a majority of 230.  Astonishing and unprecedented.  The big question now is this.  Will she listen?
I have just voted against the PM’s deal. Now awaiting the result.
After over two and a half years of negotiations, it is with just 12 minutes to go that the Prime Minister declares she is willing to look at “creative solutions”. Far too late.
https://t.co/4NqHpz8GYi
@Nigel60007 @mikegalsworthy @Andrew_Adonis Have a look at the thread I have just posted.
6/6 If the Prime Minister loses tonight the Government must reach out across the House to try and find a way forward.  If this doesn’t happen, then Parliament will have to take the lead.
5/6 All these developments mean that the House will soon have the opportunity to make it clear that it rejects no deal and so offer reassurance to the many businesses and their workers who are very anxious about the disaster that a no deal Brexit would represent.
4/6 Dominic Grieve‘s amendment and the Speaker’s ruling that a business motion can be amended are also very important and there is now a proposal for a Bill that would allow the Commons in effect to rule out a no deal Brexit by seeking an extension to Article 50 if necessary.
3/6 Since I originally tabled the amendment in December, the House has voted for a no deal amendment to the Finance Bill which is a clear and very welcome indication of MPs’ opposition to no deal.
2/6 It’s vital that we now get the clearest expression of view from the House on the Government’s deal - like many others I will vote against it - but I intend to pursue a ‘no to no deal’ vote at the earliest opportunity.
1/6 I have decided to withdraw my amendment to the Government’s Withdrawal Agreement motion today which would have rejected both the PM’s deal and leaving with no deal.
I have just asked the Prime Minister whether - if her deal is defeated tomorrow evening - she will reach out across the House of Commons in order to try and find a way forward.  I am sorry to say that she gave no such assurance.
.This is a really important initiative.  We need to be clear about the dividing line between legitimate protest and accountability as opposed to intimidating and threatening behaviour directed at elected representatives who are simply doing their job. https://t.co/65mNU9urJp

My question to the Prime Minister today. I did not get an answer. https://t.co/858eAt7sBR
In the absence of any commitment from the EU that it is willing to renegotiate Article 20 of the NI backstop, the Prime Minister’s decision to  cancel tomorrow’s vote is merely postponing the inevitable.
@SalingerRj . It’s not a fraction.  It’s actually 43%.
@robjeffecology @RidgeOnSunday @SophyRidgeSky I am.
@SalingerRj .I haven’t - that’s true - so can I suggest that you take a moment  to listen to what those who are running businesses that export to the EU say about what no deal would mean for them?
@ppp_emp @BrexitCentral . Instead of trying to use my dead father against me - what on earth makes you think this is even remotely acceptable - how about putting forward an argument?
@Rangaharris @RiceJ78 @allanholloway @TimSuperdrog They wouldn’t.  This is about delays at French ports because of checks that they don’t have to do at the moment but would have to do if we leave with no deal - checks that would  eventually result in everything backing up.
Sobering indeed. Can I encourage those arguing for a no deal Brexit to read what this says. It’s another reason why staying in the single market and a customs union is the right thing to do and why we need to vote to take no deal off the table in Parliament next week. https://t.co/bj2kF7WxF3

7. It’s not that a different approach is not possible - it still is.  It’s just that the Government has failed over two and a half years to make that choice. And that’s why their approach is bad for our future.
6. For businesses, despite the transition period, that means continuing uncertainty.  And that is bad for investment, jobs and tax revenue.
5. So the reason why the ‘deal’ will probably find it hard to win approval in the House of Commons is because it will offer no indication of where we are heading.
4. The other possibility - staying in the customs union and the single market - is ruled out by the Prime Minister’s red lines. And the Chequers proposals have been rejected by the EU.
3. The PM has ruled out a Canada-style deal because it wouldn’t keep the Northern Ireland border open as it is now and would not keep the kind of friction-free trade that many businesses rely on.
2. The reason why is because the Government’s red lines, including leaving the customs union and the single market, have completely boxed it in.
1. With all the attention being given to the Northern Ireland backstop, let’s not forget that we still have no idea what kind of long-term economic relationship we will have with the EU.
Has anyone actually seen the text of what has apparently been agreed by the negotiators on the backstop(s)?
@ford_saxon @darrengrimes_ @KulganofCrydee . I’m afraid you’re wrong about what our manifesto said. On page 24 it referred to “retaining the ￼benefits of the Single Market and the Customs Union”.

2/2 Mind you, if the Government had bothered to do an economic assessment before they decided to leave the customs union and the single market then perhaps they would have realised earlier what is at stake and just how reliant we are on this crossing.
1/2 The Brexit Select Committee went to Dover and saw the large number of lorries coming off the ferries. Last year the port handled 2.6 million lorries. I am surprised therefore that the Secretary of State hadn’t quite understood how important Dover is. https://t.co/QNQLyj5MSP

2/2 The Government has urged freeholders not to make leaseholders pay, but that’s not good enough. They need to prevent them from doing so, if necessary by law, or else my constituents will be asked for money they do not have to fix a problem they aren’t responsible for.
1/2 In response to my question in the @HouseofCommons just now, the Communities Secretary has agreed to look at the cases of Skyline Apartments and Saxton where leaseholders are facing huge bills to remove unsafe cladding.

@ecJulie @danielmgmoylan .The problem for employers will be having to distinguish between two people who both have EU passports, but where only one of them has the right to work because they were here before a No Deal Brexit.
Extraordinary. The Government said that EU citizens already here would be able to stay with the same rights, come what may.  Now they are being told that employers will have to check their right to work in the event of no deal next March, but can’t say how this will be done. https://t.co/itE9Xo8agO

8/8 An outcome in which we leave the the EU next March, thus upholding the referendum result,  but get the closest relationship with our nearest, biggest and most important trading partner, thereby minimising damage to our economy, is the best available. We should take it.
7/8 Not everyone will be happy with this approach, but no-one will get everything they want out of this mess. For too long those who argued Leave have pretended that things would all go their way. And as Remainers we have found it hard to accept that we lost.
6/8 Tell the EU that we will review all this in five years.
5/8 Say that we will introduce changes to the way in which we operate free movement - as we can under EU/EEA rules.
4/8 Say that we will join the EEA. This would solve the other part of the Irish border problem and ensure the continuation of friction-free trade which is so important to British business.
3/8 Say that the UK will remain in a customs union with the EU. This would solve part of the Irish border problem and end the threat of tariffs.
2/8 The PM has painted herself into a corner and is now discovering that complex contortion cannot get her out of it. Meanwhile it’s clear that Brexit-supporting current and former cabinet ministers simply do not have a plan. So what should we now do?
1/8 The contrast between the unity of the 27 in the Brexit negotiations and the sheer disfunctionality of the Conservative Government could not be greater.
The Prime Minister has twice avoided answering questions just now about how long the Government’s NI backstop proposal will last.  The Brexit Secretary says it must be time-limited. The PM only says it will be temporary. Who speaks for the Government?
I am so sad to hear this. Patricia was passionate, principled and Labour through and through. https://t.co/Lwk6yAz6ml
@sampson_ken No. It means that whatever happens we keep an open border in Northern Ireland and protect the Good Friday Agreement.
We are told that the main source of conflict centres around Britain’s refusal to agree to a backstop unless it has a finite end date, but if it has an end date it cannot, by definition, be a backstop that will work in all circumstances.
@Heliopolis500 . Thanks Seamus. It might help if the Government put forward its own backstop proposal. To date, however, it has only offered half a backstop.
The Brexit Select Committee said this in Dec 2017: “We do not currently see how it will be possible to reconcile there being no border with the Government’s policy of leaving the Single Market and the Customs Union”. It is this policy which is the cause of the current stand-off.
Really successful launch of the @HEALeeds Humans of Holbeck calendar at Marshall Mill.  Great photos that bring the people and the spirit of Holbeck to life. Big thank you to @NMBCo for so kindly hosting the event and for producing a special brew to mark the occasion. https://t.co/MW2ORkOS3T

3/3  What won’t do is to offer vague words about the future of our economic relationship with our biggest, nearest and most important trading partner and then expect Parliament to give its blessing. We all need clarity and certainty about where we are heading.
2/3  The Government now has to make a strategic choice - either to go for Canada or for Norway, plus a customs union. Canada would not give us friction-free trade and would not solve the problem of the Northern Ireland border.
1/3  It has been clear since the start of this month that the central elements of the Chequers proposals - the Facilitated Customs Arrangement and the common rulebook - are not acceptable to the European Union. Salzburg has today confirmed that.

. The problem, however, is that the Chequers plans for customs and a common rulebook are not acceptable to the EU. So where’s Plan B to ensure the continuation of on open Irish border and of tariff and friction-free trade that British businesses need ? 3/3
. Having wasted so much time dealing with its internal divisions, the Government needs to focus in the time that’s left on what is needed to get a deal on trade and the Irish border. 2/3
The more we hear about the risks of a No Deal Brexit – delays to lorries at Dover, invalid driving licences and disruption to rail transport and aviation – the more it becomes clear how damaging it would be for the British economy. 1/3

@MrHarryCole @SKinnock @SCrabbPembs @CommonsEUexit .

@stevenjroberts5 .How about staying in a customs union with the EU?
6. Having wasted two years, these papers show exactly why No Deal is unacceptable and why ministers must now ensure that an agreement is reached with the EU which provides a transition period and protects jobs, trade and investment.
5. Thirdly, there is still no clarity on how the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland would be avoided, and ministers have simply told businesses to seek advice from the Irish Government. This is an extraordinary abdication of responsibility
4. Secondly, there is no guarantee for British citizens living in other EU countries about the future of their pension payments
3. First, they confirm that No Deal - far from being better than a bad deal - would be very damaging economically. Businesses exporting to the EU would face the cost and bureaucracy of customs and rules of origin declarations for the first time and, in some cases, tariffs.
2. A failure to reach agreement with the EU would also mean no transition period so all this uncertainty could be just seven months away.                              The papers published today tell us three things.
1. Ministers have left their No Deal planning very late in the day. A lot of questions remain to be answered, and they seem to be relying on continued co-operation with the EU without any indication of what would happen if this was not forthcoming. 1/6
From the assertion that a trade deal with the EU would be "one of the easiest in human history" to having to prepare for the stockpiling of medicines. Proof that No Deal really would be the worst outcome of all.

@V5M1000 Can I suggest you read the whole thread?
PS There is a very long way to go on this and precious little time. We must get an agreement that helps all sectors of the British economy and all parts of the UK. No Deal would be disastrous for our country.
10. The Brexit Select Committee looks forward to taking evidence from the new Secretary of State, Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP, and Mr Oliver Robbins on 24th July.
9. Given the proposals, the Association Agreement model and governance seem sensible. However, it is clear that the CJEU will continue to have a very important say, if indirectly, in resolving any potential disputes about the proposed "common rulebook".
8. The commitment to continued participation in as many elements of foreign, security and defence policy co-operation as possible is welcome and very important for our future security.
7. While committing to end free movement of people, the Government has said very little about what will replace it. Many witnesses from business and services have told us that free movement is the most important issue for them and we urgently need clarity from ministers on this.
6. No case is made as to why this would be in the national economic interest. The Government has said it wants an agreement with the EU on mutual recognition of professional qualifications and it has finally set out proposals for financial services.
5. Despite having a trade surplus with the EU in services - which make up nearly 80% of the UK’s economy - the Government admits that we will lose current levels of access to EU markets because it is not proposing to follow EU internal market rules.
4. We have also yet to see a full proposal for a backstop arrangement to maintain an open and frictionless border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
3. On the Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-food, the key questions are: will the EU agree to it; how will it work in practice; how much bureaucracy for businesses will it involve; and can it be put in place by the end of the transition period in December 2020?
2. Having taken so long to get to this point, however, we are desperately short of time to sort everything out and many questions remain unanswered.
1. First impressions of the Brexit White Paper.  Welcome that the Government has at last set out its proposals on the future UK-EU relationship in the face of economic reality.
What will it take for the Government finally to listen to the voice of Yorkshire? Give us the tools and we will do the job. https://t.co/aD4Y8SaH3E

@bbcnickrobinson On balance Nick I think 0-1 is worse but best of all is a 2-0 victory.  Mind you, I had drawn Sweden in the Select Committee sweepstake but I think I'll cope....

@robinkellett @RLong_Bailey .Can I suggest you have a look at this? https://t.co/VX8Ym3fdeY
@bbcnickrobinson Yup!
@Peston @theresa_may .Very interesting indeed Robert, but I still think it's unlikely that the EU will agree to outsource the collection of its own tax revenues to a third country.
@B37boy @ProgressiveEur @LeedsEurope Thanks for the invitation but I was at the Hunslet and Burmantofts Galas.

@groves_kim Congratulations Kim!
@Colin00007 @DMcWilliams_UK @jbhearn @TIMGOLDFINCH @HowardArcherUK @asentance @TraderTropical On the contrary, this shows that we can trade successfully with the rest of the world while also trading successfully with the EU as part of the customs union. It's not a competition. We can do both.
@Colin00007 And if EU manufacturers decide to source everything they use from inside the EU then what happens to the 21.7 million units in parts and accessories (worth about €3.8 billion) which the UK exported to the EU last year?
@Colin00007 Indeed.  So what about the 760,000 cars the UK exported to the rest of the EU last year in the event of No Deal and the return of tarrifs?
@LeftInsider @GeorgeAylett Not so. 1. The destruction of much of Syria's infrastructure was down to Presidents Assad and Putin. 2. Daesh have been largely defeated on the ground and the people they enslaved have been liberated.
I much enjoyed meeting you all.  Thanks for coming. https://t.co/0SRyA3oPbu
@Colin00007 @purpleline @jbhearn @DMcWilliams_UK @sallycopper @TIMGOLDFINCH @asentance @HowardArcherUK Thanks Colin (if I may). There are lots of people seeking to do the same thing and the difference between us is that I see a bad Brexit deal as damaging the people I represent. That's why we need to get it right.
@Colin00007 @purpleline @jbhearn @DMcWilliams_UK @sallycopper @TIMGOLDFINCH @asentance @HowardArcherUK . How about answering the question?
@cheekychuka . Jeremy voted against a third runway too. Can I gently suggest that you work on getting your facts right before you tweet.
@Colin00007 . Don't you want a successful UK car industry creating jobs and supporting supply chains?
@cheekychuka .Excuse me. I voted against the third runway at Heathrow.
Well that's pretty clear then. Yet more support for remaining in a customs union. https://t.co/NqyrzL2lHv
@emlynsshoes . Yes, I will.

@jennymatthews9 @jk_rowling .1. Airbus doesn't make its wings and other aircraft parts inside the 'London bubble'. It makes them in 25 sites around the UK. 2. Those of us who are concerned are worried about the 14,000 people that Airbus employs, around half of them in Wales.
9. We are going to need a further transition period because so much time has been wasted (see 8. above)   10. Parliament must - and will - have the final say on the Brexit deal.
6. The public think it's all going very badly 7. There isn’t a majority in the House of Commons for a No Deal Brexit 8. Management by the Prime Minister in the party interest has taken precedence over leadership in the national interest
4. British businesses exporting to the EU don't know what to plan for which is why many support the UK remaining in a customs union 5. We still have no idea what our future relationship will be on security, foreign policy, data, approval of medicines and consumer safety
2. The Cabinet is still arguing over what kind of customs arrangements it wants with the EU 3. There is no workable proposal yet to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland
Two years after the EU referendum what do we know?  1. The promises of the ‘easiest trade deal in history’, ‘we will hold all the cards’, ‘the exact same benefits’ and ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’ have all foundered on the rock of reality

Today's crucial vote in the Commons is all about whether Parliament will have its rightful say on our future relationship with the EU after we leave.
Utterly shameful. These are images that are doing enormous damage to the reputation of the United States of America -  the land that once proclaimed "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." https://t.co/t4GmiFLiGt

@RebeccaBamford . I did support it.
@raffy158 Sorry, but that's wrong. This is about the kind of Brexit we will pursue and not about whether we leave.
Today's vote on the Brexit meaningful vote is the most important one over these next two days. It will decide whether Parliament has the final say on the EU Withdrawal Agreement.
Not surprising given that it was only half a backstop. The Government now needs to say what it would do about EU regulations. https://t.co/yV5OMDtwas
@0Calamity Thanks a lot!
@0Calamity .I will be voting for Keir's amendment.  But if it doesn't pass then I will vote for the EEA amendment - we should keep our options open.  And by the way, I've been campaigning for Labour Governments ever since I first knocked on a door in the 1970 General Election.

@faisalislam I agree Faisal, but the EU seems to be arguing that "the UK will maintain" refers to the body that will ensure that full alignment happens (the UK) as opposed to the geographical area to which it will apply (Northern Ireland). They are wrong,

Here's my reaction to the Government's backstop proposal for the Northern Ireland border with the Irish Republic. https://t.co/escNUZwYTO
How can the Northern Ireland backstop proposal be time-limited when ministers have no idea at all when alternative customs arrangements would be a) agreed and b) implemented?

@LabourLordsUK I am so sad to hear this. Anne was a wonderful comrade and a passionate advocate for equality. Thoughts are with her family and many friends.

@linda_whyman @UKLabour @ChrisLeslieMP @YvetteCooperMP she will come to Parliament first, she will share such evidence as she can with us, as she has done today, and she will trust Parliament to decide what is to be done?"
@linda_whyman @UKLabour @ChrisLeslieMP @YvetteCooperMP before committing our forces to action. Therefore, may I ask her to give us an assurance that in the event—heaven forbid—that President Assad chooses to use chemical weapons against innocent civilians once again,
@linda_whyman @UKLabour @ChrisLeslieMP @YvetteCooperMP Of course we must uphold the international prohibition on the use of chemical weapons but, as someone who supported military action against Daesh in Syria in the vote in December 2015, I say gently to the Prime Minister that she should have come first to the House

@darrengrimes_ If it's really nonsense then why, 20 months on, hasn't the Government yet been able come forward with a specific plan to ensure a border with no checks and no infrastructure ?
On 26 Oct 2017 I asked David Davis whether he believed that "we can get a free‑trade and customs agreement negotiation concluded in the period before March 2019.” He replied "Yes". I don't think the Government believes that any more.    Sent from my iPad
The Government has now at last had to acknowledge that the UK's future economic relationship with the EU won't be finalised until the transition period.
@katieguacamole He is greatly missed Katie.
Sadly, but not surprisingly, there were no answers to my questions today about future customs policy after we leave the EU.

He continued "we have already made certain commitments—to our agricultural community, for example—to maintain spending at EU levels until the end of this Parliament."  So where is the supposed Brexit dividend?
The Chancellor told Parliament on Tuesday that the OBR has "assumed that any saving from a lower contribution to the European Union will be recycled to fund things that would have been funded by the EU, but will no longer be so."
Unfortunately this is not the first time this has happened.... https://t.co/mMRQdBhXgW
The Government should now ask the OPCW to carry out an investigation into the use of a banned nerve agent in Salisbury in an attempt to kill, including by inspecting facilities in Russia where in all likelihood it was produced.
@LeftwingPoet Thank you so much.

5/6 Seeks a new free trade agreement with no customs or regulatory checks. Can anyone point to such a deal currently?
4/6 Says that UK regulatory standards will remain substantially the same as the EU’s after we leave.  So what’s happened to regulatory divergence?
3/6 Accepts that UK access to the EU market will be less than it is now and that EU law will continue to affect us.
2/6 Welcome commitment to remaining in EU agencies that are important for our industries like the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency, and the European Aviation Safety Agency

@Peston @theresa_may A managed anticipation
@merchantcp @ShelaghFogarty "If you go to the border now, you see that the trucks are  stopped. They are in a long line to declare their papers, but most trucks can  pass through rather rapidly..." Ulf Sverdrup of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs giving evidence to the Brexit Committee 7 Feb
@merchantcp @ShelaghFogarty I can't see any lorries so a photo of the places where the lorries actually stop on that border while the papers are checked would be more relevant. Lovely picture though!
The evidence suggests it's slightly more complicated than that. https://t.co/zQuzyVNZA6
@RuariJM @HilaryBennLeeds Indeed - they are not.  But all free trade deals require some customs checks so how does a FTA with the EU keep the border in Northern Ireland open with no checks and no infrastructure?
@OlliehaddoLeave @Keir_Starmer @MarrShow We actually benefit from those trade deals.
@AutomaticDrivin @EFTAsecretariat @EFTA4UK Thanks, but I didn't say it was.  I was pointing out that we can co-operate economically with other European countries while not being an EU member - as we have done in the past.
To those of you who say that remaining in a customs union is incompatible with leaving the EU, remember that the UK was a founder member of the  the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) which agreed full free trade in industrial products in 1966 ie when we weren't in the EU.
@PeterWard09 Really? Weren't we told that Brexit was all about Parliament taking back control?
Now we need Parliament to have a vote on staying in a customs union with the EU. The Prime Minister should stop trying to delay this.
Very clear statement by @Keir_Starmer on Labour's support for staying in a customs union with the EU. The right decision for the economy and for jobs and one which will be widely welcomed by LP members. @MarrShow

Huge thanks to @IainMcNicol for everything you have done for our Party and our movement. Wishing you all the best for the future. https://t.co/wRC8MUYIrR
Wonderfully moving and powerful speech by @JulieElliottMP in support of Geoffrey Robinson’s Private Members’ Bill, which seeks to introduce a national opt-out system for organ donation in England.
In Parliament today to support this very important Bill. In death we can help give life to others, so let's talk about organ donation with our families. @Geoffrey4CovNW @JulieElliottMP https://t.co/ZNHaunVzjg

@janeennis Thank you so much Jane.
@faisalislam Sounds like another argument for staying in a customs union with the EU.
@bbclaurak .Here is the analysis which shows that leaving a customs union with the EU is not in the national economic interest. Why is the Prime Minister so determined to go ahead regardless ?
@lfpme @PaulBlomfieldMP The treatment of Ahed Tamimi is all about the rights of the child and due process under the law.
@GavinBarwell Thanks, but that wasn't the question I asked. It was about how we keep the Northern Ireland border with the Republic without checks or infrastructure if we are leaving the customs union and replacing it with a free trade agreement.
No answer from the PM just now to my question on why she is so determined to leave a customs union with the EU when this would be completely incompatible with keeping an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.
@dresserman How do I fix that?
@dresserman No. I'm pretty confident there weren't iPhones then.....
@willshome Indeed. And here's the Act that gave all women the vote. Dad was very proud of the plaque he put up in memory of Emily Wilding Davison. https://t.co/ftrSwMKsex

@nigrugthug @MariannaMasters Thanks and finally. 1. I was opposed to joining the Euro. 2. Labour thankfully kept us out of the Euro. 3. Resorting to capital letters doesn't really help persuade anyone that a hard border in Northern Ireland can be avoided if we leave the customs union.
@TanDhesi @SikhWarMemorial https://t.co/2NgMzLwsAd
Brilliant presentation in Parliament by @GaryVerity on this year's @letouryorkshire route. The great legacy of the 2014 Tour de France Grand Départ continues.
@nigrugthug Under the Everything but Arms (EBA) agreement all imports to the EU from the Least Developed Countries are duty-free and quota-free, with the exception of armaments.
@nigrugthug The BBC report on the Norway/Sweden border says that even with technology and cooperation between both authorities, the average waiting time for trucks at the designated border crossing is 8 minutes. That is not an open border with no infrastructure. And as for Dover....
@nigrugthug Never mind my iPhone, if that's a picture of a frictionless open border between Norway and Sweden then why are the trucks stationary? Could it be because there are in fact customs checks?
Why we should stay in a customs union with the EU https://t.co/45FNbSNWDQ
@Para_glider69 If that's the answer, why did the Government commit to full alignment as a fallback to solve the Northern Ireland border question?
@Watsonmrk @Para_glider69 Which is our largest export market by country?
@Para_glider69 Thanks. Anyone trading with the EU needs to abide by their rules on product standards anyway and a trade deal, rather than staying in a customs union, would mean checks at the border in Northern Ireland which no-one wants. Choices have consequences.
@Para_glider69 I'm not. We will be leaving the institutions of the EU at the end of March 2019. This debate is about how we trade with and sell services to the EU in future.
@bbcnickrobinson To which there is currently no answer!  All that has happened today is that a No 10 spokesperson has ruled out yet another option but we are still none the wiser as to what the PM wants.
I agree! https://t.co/L1JCcwd5wh
@bbcnickrobinson .So how does the Government plan to maintain an open border in Northern Ireland?
@iainmalcolmuk @SShieldsLabour Thanks Iain for your warm welcome and for everything you and your great team of councillors are doing for the local community.

@palfreman @LauraPidcockMP .I think it means that the original decisions aren't reliable.
In the last 12 months, an astonishing 57% of tribunal appeals against personal independence payment assessments in Leeds were successful. This shows just how the system is failing. Thanks to @LauraPidcockMP for raising this in Parliament tomorrow.
DexEU minister Steve Baker says of civil service forecasts “I think they are always wrong.” Hardly encouraging to the civil servants who have been asked by the same ministers to try and forecast the likely impact of Brexit on our industries. We'd all like to see their work.
@LeedsNews A wise decision by the club.
We are now 19 months on from the referendum and neither Parliament nor the rest of EU are any the wiser about what the Government actually wants from the Brexit negotiations. Extraordinary and unacceptable.
@SamCoatesTimes .It would seem from this that an analysis of the economic impact of different options for Brexit has been done. When do ministers intend to tell Parliament about what they show?
@MrGrinchy .You can become a company director at the age of 16 so why should you not also be able to vote?

@BillCookcapg Thanks. Also have a look at the Chancellor's response to me in the House just now.
@BillCookcapg Hang on.  It appears that the Government is now paying the wages of Carillion workers delivering public services under PFI contracts. How can it be right to then sell those contracts on with the continuing public sector annual fee payments?
Carillion's administrators should not be allowed to sell on its PFI contracts to other private sector companies. No reward for failure!
No answer from the Government to my question in the House just now asking for confirmation that the administrator will not be allowed to sell on Carillion PFI contracts to other private companies.  No reward for failure!
@BBCAlagiah All your friends are rooting for you George.

Given that this will be the third time in just over a decade that a private company running the East Coast mainline franchise will be handing back the keys early, it's now time to take the line back into public ownership.
No explanation from Liam Fox as to why the Government decided to leave the Customs Union without having undertaken any assessment at all of the economic impact of doing so.

Just raised in Parliament the case of constituents who bought new properties leasehold from Miller Homes in Hunslet only to discover that the freehold had been sold on to a company that now wants to charge them unreasonable fees to buy the freehold.  They must get compensation.
The PM couldn't answer questions today about whether under her full alignment fall-back scheme manufactured goods and agricultural products will still be able to cross the NI border with the Republic without any checks or controls. So what exactly is she guaranteeing?

@HelenMagi I am standing up for Leeds and making the point that if those are the rules then why did it take the EU Commission 17 months to let the bidders know?
@StuartClarkeUK @BBCLeeds Maybe or maybe not given we don't know what the outcome of the negotiations will be. But if they are the rules then why wait until all the bids went in before telling us?
@BBCLeeds A terrible blow to Leeds’ great 2023 bid which has support from across the city. Also inexplicable given that in the past Bergen and Istanbul have both been awarded the title when neither are in the EU. The European Commission must now explain this act of blatant discrimination.

It isn't clear what ministers think, they still hope they can negotiate a bespoke deal by next Oct when no-one else thinks that's possible..

.....so why not just change policy and announce we're staying in the customs union after all?
Having wrongly decided to leave the customs union, ministers are now desperately trying to find a way of remaining in it......
@MikeBarthorpe Delighted to hear this Mike.
@ZoomyZoomy1111 No I didn't. I voted for airstrikes against Daesh.
All our thoughts are with the people of Barcelona tonight - the grieving families of the dead and the injured.
@PeterNimmo1 No. I am talking about staying in the customs union.
... but also wants to replace it with "time-limited customs union between the UK and the EU Customs Union". Why not just stay in?
Today's Government position paper says it wants to leave the EU customs union after March 2019....
@FleeNicko  please email me at bennh@parliament.uk
This is exactly why the UK should remain in the customs union. It solves the border problem and ensures tariff-free trade. https://t.co/LgsJgDmput

@Johncurtis1889 Oops - don't know what happened there! Have deleted it, but any advice?
@2tweetaboutit @timloughton No. But pretending you might leave with no deal fools no-one when we know it would damage our economy and jobs.
@Alex_Dinham @SkyNews No manoeuvring at all. I respect the result, but I am against 'no deal' because it would be bad for British businesses and people's jobs.
The Queen's Speech shows how Labour's success in gaining seats has put an end to the Tory idea of bringing back the 11 plus.

@LeedsNews @JoannaWardill Why did the Inspector ignore the views of local people, local councillors, the local MP and the Council?
The Tories now have no mandate for the return of the 11 plus.
The 'No EU deal is better than a bad deal' mantra is now dead in the water. I can't see the new Parliament supporting such a damaging idea.

@SurajBhanot OK, because Labour is committed to the 0.7% aid target. And free primary school meals. And a properly funded NHS. And more council housing.
This is why the UK's commitment to the 0.7% aid target matters so much to so many. Don't let the Tories walk away from it. #GE2017 #UKLabour https://t.co/VMvtxwIIee
Thanks for speaking up Stephen. This is completely unacceptable. https://t.co/MsM1D8rJqA
Britain's commitment to help the world's poorest people says a lot about the kind of country we are. Keep the 0.7%.
The PM needs to understand that Parliament's job is not to cheerlead her Brexit plans but to scrutinise them to get the best deal
Looking forward to the campaign in Leeds Central. #UKLabour #GE2017 https://t.co/c6m6Ol4rpv
@BBCLeeds Exactly why we must ensure no return to tariffs or other barriers as a result of Brexit. Walking away with no deal would damage our economy.

.@patrickwintour Reminder. On 24 May 2016  a minister told the House that "we assess that no UK-supplied cluster weapons have been used"
.@patrickwintour @AlArabiya_Eng  This is an extraordinary admission.

.@DilysDavies @ComediansForYes  https://t.co/TwSjFyYlNN https://t.co/myDBCKPY20 https://t.co/ApokV1MP4G
To sum up. 1. No evidence RAF bombed Aleppo. 2. No evidence of "indiscriminate bombing" by RAF. 3. No apologies for these false accusations.
.@DilysDavies This estimate is that 89% of those killed in Syria died at the hands of their own Government https://t.co/LdramaAkYf
.@RatherBAPear You seem to have gone rather quiet. Is that because you have no evidence to back up your accusations against the RAF?
.@ComediansForYes  Can you produce any evidence for that statement?  If not, how about apologising to our RAF pilots? #PostTruthTweets2
.@RatherBAPear @PCSoblahdeehell So where's your evidence that the RAF have engaged in "indiscriminate bombing"?
.@ComediansForYes  Russia and Syria did this, not the UK - as I suspect you well know. #PostTruthTweets
.@RatherBAPear @PCSoblahdeehell Well you've accepted that Daesh need "destroying." The question is how? Now how about answering my question?
.@RatherBAPear So would you have voted for the motion last year "taking military action, specifically airstrikes, exclusively against ISIL?"
.@RatherBAPear  Will you publish the resolution we actually voted on? It proves that you are misleading people. I hope it's not deliberate.
.@RatherBAPear ...and talking of shame, why not a word from any of you about Daesh and its campaign of genocide? #silence
.@RatherBAPear  Why do you continue to pretend that the UK has anything to do with the bombing of Aleppo? We don't. It's Syria and Russia...

Selfless, principled and courageous decision by @angelaeagle - now is the time to unite behind @OwenSmith_MP to give Labour new leadership
@sa5613_ @DiscoverThee  You mean like my opposition to the bedroom tax, £9,000 tuition fees and abolishing nursing bursaries?
Tonight Labour MPs will decide whether to support or oppose Trident renewal - both on principle - but abstaining isn't a credible position.
@Chairmanmeaow @palestininianpr No. On that logic we would have to accept the election of a Tory government and not oppose it. Absurd idea.
How does holding a view make someone anti-democratic when surely a democracy is all about being free to do precisely that? @palestininianpr

Aren't all these the result of “winning" in a democracy, Jon? @jonlansman
And free eye tests for the over 60s and free entry to national museums and galleries @jonlansman
And scrapping Section 28 and introducing Civil Partnerships @jonlansman
And setting up 2,200 Sure Start Children’s Centres @jonlansman
And restoring city-wide government to London @jonlansman
And devolution for Scotland and Wales @jonlansman
And writing off up to 100 per cent of the debt owed by the poorest countries @helenrcaton @jonlansman
Jon - maybe I have misunderstood what you were trying to say but winning is what enabled Labour to create the NHS @jonlansman
Great news about the LGI's success in securing the future of children's heart surgery in Leeds. It's been a long campaign - thanks everyone.
