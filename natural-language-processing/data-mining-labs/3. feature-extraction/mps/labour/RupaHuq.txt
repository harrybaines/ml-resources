My question to Maybot yesterday:   Even her own defence minister in 2018 said referendum result from 2016 looking rather old and its now 2019    MPs are unable to sort this. We need a #peoplesvote her deal v option to remain as only way out of the stalemate https://t.co/oWKVvC07GS
Hi @EalingHour Nursing poorly son so missing Turnham Green meeting on Heathrow with @RuthCadburyand @hammersmithandy tonight but to clarify this December @EalingCouncil passed motion opposing expansion
On the 8th Dec 2018 (before PM withdrew meaningful Vote) government defence minister @Tobias_Ellwood wisely tweeted the following, saying that June 2016 was starting to look a long time ago and that a fresh reassessment would soon be needed. I quoted these words to the PM today. https://t.co/FOd9PhHXYH
My q to PM today:  - Withdrawal Agreement was reached when 136 days to Brexit - Before meaningful vote was pulled in Dec with 110 days to departure @Tobias_Ellwood was warning of the 2016 mandate being old - Now 45 days left  Only way out = #peoplesvote  https://t.co/DpIypAkabn

As someone who was called @ThangamMP by a female cabinet minister on Thursday is the conclusion @faizashaheen @AyoCaesar and me should draw from all this that we are all just interchangeable to them?   Boney M's "Brown Girl in the Ring" comes to mind https://t.co/LEuyTQx909
Did @SkyNews with @adamboultonSKY on Malthouse compromise, Sounds like a fudge to keep the Tory party together and would need agreement from the EU27 so another fantasy proposal.

Theresa May told me she has spent 24 hours since Oct answering Brexit questions then promptly didn't answer my question.

@stevemnewbold @TheNewEuropean Hi Steve, She says her door is open but wont work if her mind is closed. A majority of MPs from across all parties have voted against this already and lots of the cabinet are saying same thing so it would be easy way for PM to gain goodwill
Apparently this Dutch is a headline from yesterday*   *translates as bang; bash; battle; beat; beating; blight; blow; bop; bounce; box; bump https://t.co/CWzxUYC4Y9
Given chancellor talks of Article 50 being revoked in private and we know that cabinet figures also including Rudd, Gauke, Clark have threatened to walk out if we crash out, Jeremy is right to insist on May ruling out no deal. Here's me @TheNewEuropean   https://t.co/gHh2jenoFi
Brexit crisis= culmination of catalogue of errors  - triggering article 50 with no plan - laying down red lines boxing her her in - frittering away weeks in a general election - wasting time by cancelling Dec 20 vote  - resisting all scrutiny  Only sensible way out = #PeoplesVote https://t.co/LyfPK4aoW0

Things that UK has become good at whilst Brexit uncertainly continues  1. Fridge purchase (Matt Hancock boasted he’s biggest buyer of them in world to stockpile drugs)   2.

Theresa May's blackmail Brexit is costing us £££ every day, well before we get to the £39 billion divorce cost. I asked her how much she has wasted since the pulled vote on December 11th. I'd have accepted an answer in pounds or Euros but got no sum https://t.co/f1Gtznr2KS

202 to 432. Crushing defeat for PM’s wretched “deal”. PM on feet spouting robotic messages, the woman has ZERO humility
Just went through same voting lobby with Boris Johnson. Would’ve down so over Heathrow expansion but on that occasion he fixed a trip to Afghanistan at taxpayer expense to tune of £20,000
Leader of the House just belatedly spoke to my pal Tulip Siddiq who is here for the vote in wheelchair and was due to give birth today (to apologise). No one should have to go through this but after how they treated @joswinson @NazShahBfd no one trusts Tories anymore on this

Only logical way to sort intractable impasse that could garner cross-party support is a #peoplesvote https://t.co/d7xEZFanwX
@nickmurftweets Hi Nick, glad to have been your servant since 2015 and flattered receive this accolade, happy to discuss away from here if you want to email?
@tugsandtost @jbwhitesnake Very frustrating as normal MP at PMQs as you have to be drawn out of a hat (there are 650 of us) and no chance of a follow-up to reply you get
Remember once shouting “Paddy Pantsdown” at him across a station concourse when I was much, much younger and was honoured to get a reply from him earlier this year after a mass APPG email, even if it did say “can you take me off this list?”   Sad news... https://t.co/fYsrwmXg3C
To those contacting me on apparent policy shift in today’s Guardian interview, I’ve finally had chance to go through paper.

Case of my constituent tweeted yesterday reaches @DailyMirror Since highlighting yesterday others have now appeared in inbox. Universal Credit cannot go on as it is https://t.co/GhcJyOQ1mo
More revaluations of what *really* goes on in chamber... always great to sit in earshot of Liz who has wittiest ripostes off-mic eg Corbyn asking about backhanders to Surrey CC to be stonewalled by Maybot she retorted “What about Surrey? Surrey seems to be the hardest word”. https://t.co/M5gBA91ZYE

Thanks to all emails/tweets offering to help Paulette. Spoke to her earlier, she’s going to aunt via a lift.

Heading into my office in Parliament. PM is right for saying in this clip that MPs work even on Commons non-sitting days but Justine Greening is more right that 3 weeks recess and denying us meaningful vote (due Dec 11th) until 14th Jan unjustifiable at a time of national crisis https://t.co/3khJPFFXue

My question to Liam Fox on international trade, reported by ⁦@BBCParliament⁩ greatest hits of today https://t.co/imdoJFgAYI
If I was allowed to finish what I was saying I’d have pointed out (a) women constantly jeered in Commons (b) ethnic minority women most - one MP friend was told “go home Paki” while doing a PMQ (c) Jeremy Corbyn has never engaged in usual boorish antics, this was orchestrated https://t.co/gMFDej7AoF
Too right: proved today by the phoney Tory outrage over Jeremy Corbyn’s non-remark in Commons chamber (not even uttered out loud) https://t.co/lqYFovmFMd
Pathetic scenes in Commons. Our constituents will be despair at this charade and pettiness while real issues need resolving. https://t.co/X3UADnNoy5

After MPs finally get the promised “meaningful vote” on Theresa May’s deal, if it fails and a general election is unachievable, it’s time to see if the will of the people circa 2016 is still the will of the people by putting it to a #peoplesvote with the option to remain https://t.co/lNowYKqMJI

High drama as part of a long day. Cash, Greening, Grieve, Jenkins, Soubry, Wollaston all stood with opposition parties demanding emergency debate on shambles of government that makes one long for old days of omnishambles before @lloyd_rm barred for swinging mace #anarchyintheUK
Serious point... PM marches us all to the top of the hill and then WITHDRAWS vote on Withdrawal bill. How can anyone negotiate with her in good faith or trust anything she ever says again? https://t.co/vVVFZ5ushn
PM on her feet delivering statement. Never seen House so full or Tories so glum. She seems to have mistaken saving her own skin with national interest once again by “deferring” the vote
A week ago Theresa May did a statement after G20 Summit, I asked on her broken promises regarding anti-corruption . Now looks like she's also broken promises made as recently as this morning by Michael Gove on meaningful vote Tues of MPs on her disastrous Brexit deal - farcical! https://t.co/gwlFlgfOrm
She shouldn't just be pulling the vote.   If PM is right that her deal is the best one possible then failing an election it needs to be put before voters with an option to remain  Now we know article 50 unilaterally revocable, it needs extending to allow time for a #peoplesvote
Always nice to be invited to dinner, alas not doable on night of meaningful vote! https://t.co/pXjC11G7iW

There is no good Brexit- hard or soft, May’s deal or no deal. Daily revelations show it eg BBC News reporting Brexit deal 'will cost UK £100bn' by 2030. That is why I’ll be voting against the “deal” and you should be able to have a say too via #peoplesvote https://t.co/Ij3EqXeUsH

Was that a tear in Junker’s eye as he said on tv it’s a moment of sadness for the EU to see the UK leave?   In some ways that was the easy bit now as PM’s operation shifts to persuading MPs to back this heap of junk. https://t.co/qq1x2nldrR
Can we have no Brexit please? https://t.co/hKZzZwTJfZ
Jeremy Hunt in 2016 advocated a #peoplesvote but now with an eye on leadership battle ahead and Tory membership he’s changed his mind! We should all be given the opportunity to endorse or reject the deal, not just 650 MPs. If Jeremy can change his mind, anyone can https://t.co/mO7E6w0s8m
Reflection of state of Tories in London that they can’t find an MP from capital for ⁦London⁩ Sunday Politics. Great job by ⁦@Siobhain_MP⁩ though including her conversion to #PeoplesVote More and more MPs coming over to this as only way out of deal that pleases very few https://t.co/4nSLk9Ak5Q
Nigel Farage claimed 52-48 result should signal a #peoplesvote if REMAIN won. 2016 piece says “he’d claim the referendum was unfair while the other side would accuse him of sour grapes and being a bad loser.” Even more reason now we KNOW it was illegal https://t.co/Nem4LBOKQq

Went on Sky this morning to argue that Theresa May is being held to ransom by extremist Brexiteers who's she's trying to palm off with her shoddy deal.

Like David Davis, I was also in Washington in the week.

Good to speak to Ealing Independent College 6th formers just now. Lots of questions but depressingly whereas in 2015 they’d have been about all sorts today almost 100% on Brexit and how to stop it.

I’m on a cross-party Parliamentary delegation with serious Brexiteers this week who are saying similar. One thing is clear if you voted leave or remain this is not what anyone wanted.

A huge chunk of nearly 13,000 readers of a Murdoch press title can’t be wrong...  Whether you were a leaver or a remainer, a #PeoplesVote on the Brexit deal is the most democratic next step   NB Answer to next week’s poll is also YES https://t.co/KLJW8J0jIX
Very much enjoying new Dr Who series. The new gang complete with Bradley Walsh and use of grime music to repel spiders all remind me of Sarah Jane Adventures (where Tinie Tempah destroyed Nazis). RIP Ealing-dweller Lis Sladen https://t.co/AgruiQmw4e
Clocks gone back an hour overnight. Brexiteers aim to take them to 1970s including Jacob Rees-Mogg, living up to his “honourable member for the 18th century” epithet with old school backdrop this morning. https://t.co/H6ezgAlKPT

A first for me: cover of @Telegraph politicalmy not normally my thing. Used it to stand up for vulnerable women, Parliamentary privilege and explain @UKLabour policy to stop non-disclosure agreements to buy silence by wealthy in cases of harassment and discrimination https://t.co/6tJ4ccLrNT

@lunaperla @PeterHain @BBCNews Ooops meant to be say "Justice should be a universal value, not a commodity buyable by rich and powerful" - darn the Twitter word limit. Hope the clip is clear though...
@JamieONeill1985 @PeterHain @BBCNews HHHmm yes that's a whole other tweet but actually with his title and first name, just fits in character limit. PG in full would take it over!
Bad value for Sir Philip who spent 7 fig sum trying to suppress allegations from victims AND press reporting but good for @PeterHain in rare use of Parliamentary privilege to bust cobwebs of secrecy. Justice should not be universal NOT buyable by the rich &amp; powerful. Me @BBCNews https://t.co/Nl1POT20c5

Hurrah for @PeterHain There is no justification for this abuse of power where the rich and powerful can buy their way out of trouble. The next Labour government will legislate to ban NDAs which suppress the disclosure of discrimination, harassment or victimisation. https://t.co/ivJLjd2aBG

Cautionary tale: when you’ve been looking for something all over and it’s under your nose: great to discover Woolsey of Acton near Southfield Rd W4  had obscure 25x1 inner tube. Proprietor David lived there from age 7 in 1952! #EalingHour Found it on E3 rather than internet https://t.co/0PXoNe4FrA

Former @MayorofEaling Tejinder Bagha who sadly passed away last week is laid to rest today. An @EalingLabour stalwart for many years he will be much missed. Here he is with @DrOnkarSahota @Valerie_VazMP @BarryGardiner and myself @VirendraSharma constituency dinner. RIP Tej https://t.co/7saW8nCc2s

Like head-teachers, this Tory government is radicalising tax-inspectors, as seen on @PCSL_SE @pcs_union demo against closure of @HMRCgovuk Ealing office, last in crucial Heathrow corridor now Staines, Wembley, Uxbridge gone. 260 jobs in balance and post-Brexit redundancies afoot https://t.co/ixqGYCNb1X

This is TODAY. Come and show your opposition to this short-sighted closure https://t.co/jthtMrIe5Y
My latest @EalingGazette column laments our disappearing world locally: A &amp; Es, hospital wards, police stations, Acton Post office, Ealing Tax Office. There are demos this week against the last two. Since deadline learnt South Acton and Acton Central ticket offices for chop too https://t.co/RMBSuYY87v
Tories disdain for dissent seen not only in saboteurs and mutineers rhetoric but now booting out of two MEPs who defied the whip in not supporting Hungarian fascist Orban and being pro-EU https://t.co/RR2eN6GnJg
J.Hunt speech to barely populated hall in Brum; tying his colours to “leave” mast, belligerent towards Europeans and Labour, Thatcher-evoking but oddly flat in tone. His predecessor’s content often iffy but at least mustered what passes for passion in delivery https://t.co/K0iTmw12Rd

Shaun Bailey as Tory London mayor candidate shows they’ve abandoned the city. He made crippling cuts to the police and youth services as a Number 10 adviser, peddles gutter politics of dog whistle Islamophobia and cannot be trusted. #keepKhanandcarryon https://t.co/u7jJmFd2UO

MPs from all parties including even Kenneth Clarke wrote to Sajid Javid wanting action to protect women using abortion clinics from intimidation. Disappointingly the review's conclusion does not commit to any change and bizzarely does not even contain the word "women" once! https://t.co/4DtOLtHTWX
By slipping out Abortion Clinic announcement review at last minute and promising nothing, government has passed the buck onto already cash-strapped local authorities. This is not good enough. Quizzed minister on how many women suffering it will take before change occurs... https://t.co/IaRVIaDJUv
Disappointing Home Office Abortion clinic protests review talks of “distress” and “extremely difficult and personal process” but no change to take place and word “women” entirely absent. Will keep pushing for women’s access to healthcare as human right https://t.co/8FfePNM64K

Was asked at a street-party today how realistic #bodyguard is. Have never known dizzy heights of high office but so far lead role doesn't seem to do constituency stuff, or go even there. Not a street party/ advice surgery/ church fete in sight which all MPs cover to some degree
Great street party,* festival and even #labourdoorstep weather (with @CllrAnand Ealing Common's first ever Labour ward representative) all weekend. What's betting that it'll go properly Autunmnal from tomorrow? *Fletcher Road, Chiswick https://t.co/QkEeS5i8Kw

Surely you could’ve have a word with your mate Theresa May who you’re always pictured with? Councils are cash-strapped as it is, avoiding legal action when Heathrow pollution already illegal would mean more £££ for communities https://t.co/h2iA87NAKw https://t.co/J23vJZBe8B

As predicted Boris situation changing by minute as PM calls for unspecified "apology" but this is not a 70s sitcom, he's supposed to be a statesman and sources say he wont. Tories need to undertake an investigation into Islamophobia in their ranks as @SayeedaWarsi urging for ages https://t.co/XmFgcXmvdn
Was on @SkyNews with @KayBurley on how the worst Foreign Secretary ever now pandering to the racist right, fixated by next Tory leadership race. Conservative co-interviewee said Boris should have the whip withdrawn. Too right seeing as he IS becoming a cut price Enoch Powell https://t.co/xOqmglz3wM
Hi @official_ohg after inbox of resident complaints at Bollo Lane went to see fit myself - no water since weekends and lift broken since 2012. Families and elderly. Can you get in touch with me ASAP 0207 219 6865 to sort as their complaints falling on deaf ears

Lost in narrative of May narrowly winning Brexit votes by cheating on pairing. We *won* amendment to stay in EMA drugs regulator that’s to move from London. This is what can happen when rebel Tories can be persuaded to vote with opposition. Good work Paul https://t.co/ye4PF1Lz4w
On 6th April 2019 there are contract changes on routes 207 and 607. The 207 is leaving Metroline and going to Abellio with a mix of 16 existing diesel buses cascaded off the C2 and 15 new hybrid Enviro 400 MMCs (the same buses as the 427).
Wise words from Cathy @cycletraining aka Dr Bike: “Brexit is like your bicycle; the more you take it apart the more complications you uncover. 2016 was just yes or no. We need a #PeoplesVote on what the negotiations throw up at the end”. Thanks for my sorting puncture too https://t.co/wMhhV4s2mt

Theresa May pre-referendum warned of Britain becoming a "safe haven for European criminals" outside European warrant, risking law abiding citizens lives. Her EU white paper doesnt commit to keep us in post-Brexit so I asked her about this mismatch and got nothing concrete back. https://t.co/SKpc702wJh
Floundering May no match for Corbyn's forensic PMQs on how so many cabinet ministers were part of the leave campaigns now deemed to have broken the law. This attitude destroys trust in politics - as does skipping off from Parliament 5 days early which thankfuly she's u-turned on
Turkeys voting for Christmas?

Farcical scenes in House of Commons as sitting suspended by Speaker so everyone can scurry off to get a copy of Government's overdue white paper. New Brexit minister Domninc Raab was waffling on about document no-one's had had any sight of. He suggested they look on the web (!)

We are yet to receive any assurances from the @Conservatives that the tax payer won’t be picking up the bill for #HeathrowExpansion   I very much doubt that my constituents want to subsidise the organised vandalism of villages like Harmondsworth &amp; Sipson.  #NoThirdRunway https://t.co/QGdhAGcApA

Today I will be voting against #HeathrowExpansion   1. There is already illegal levels of pollution in the area. 2. It will negatively impact other smaller airports. 3. Whole villages and communities will be torn down &amp; ripped apart.   #NoThirdRunway https://t.co/Aw6EikrnZJ

As I said to @BethRigby on @SkyNews it was @theresa_may as Home Secretary that created the hostile environment policy which caused this problem. @sajidjavid's announcement that he will relax visa regs for NHS staff is nothing but a sticking plaster over a self-inflicted wound. https://t.co/jKCtUQ3zvl

I'm more accustomed to @uwl_su than dreaming spires, but want all students in Ealing, Acton and Chiswick to aim high and was with @OxUniLabour on Sat who told me about initiative to work with authorities @DavidLammy et al. Good to see @BenFernando2 got it in the paper after all https://t.co/HFOrZqcyYi

With @PreetKGillMP @jeremycorbyn @MarshadeCordova commemorating solemn occasion of 1984 Amritsar massacre. Remember it happening. Justice for Sikhs still not achieved so we fight on https://t.co/KBguUEvLO4
Proud to have viewed award-winning film about improving playground space made by @Dwaterw3 primary pupils @HouseofCommons today. Recorded my reaction which’ll be be subsumed into a longer version going on YouTube - watch this space! https://t.co/D5Nrkmk8ST
Was at Ealing United Synagogue for a night of Jewish music spanning West Side Story, Fiddler on the Roof, shalom aleichem and many more. Proud to report back. Fun concert  happy to report @EalingHour https://t.co/iy6FLhMYP2
A new runway at Heathrow when over 9000 premature deaths a year in London are attributed to toxic air.  Failing Grayling obviously shares David Cameron’s idea of “cutting the green crap”  What ever happened to “vote blue go green”? #Heathrow #HeathrowExpansion https://t.co/dzddIqfvYS
Was told in 2016 that there would be decision on this that Summer by David Cameron (remember him?) Now government is not only 2 years late but has u-turned on previous opposition as I pointed in Commons to Chris Grayling today https://t.co/U0310zpzgH
Since these assurances against the third runway we’ve had *cancellation of the feed-in tariff *green light to Hinckley point *embrace of fracking - all making a complete mockery of the promise to be greenest government ever https://t.co/NueAX291Cx
Good to spend time with @CapeFundraising who provide multifaceted with mental health services in Acton and a charity shop in Churchfield Road. A great example of best practice this #volunteersweek2018 https://t.co/SbHXL5vQTX

@WEP_Ealing @RuthCadbury It's not a debate this evening but what's known as an S024 application to get one tabled, usually for next day. Have been asking about abortion this afternoon and Ruth and I are both here today so be assured that we are completely onside https://t.co/2WmOL0Zng9

Instructive visit @kewgardens Saw newly restored temperate House, heard of local schools youth explainers scheme, discounted entry for community groups to combat loneliness &amp; word-beating cutting-edge scientific research conducted onsite - all just a 65 bus ride away from Ealing https://t.co/snvo8CvdDQ

@ruskin147 Sorry to hear. Let me know if anything I can do in my capacity as your MP.
Members of BAME communities at all levels of society have to deal with prejudice and racial profiling on a daily basis.  As seen in the @EveningStandard last week, I'm not the only MP to have faced issues in Westminster. https://t.co/mBVGw6hA8a
Yesterday was behind the scenes at Old Oak Crossrail depot, today been with @TfL at Park Royal bus depot owned by RATP. Met apprentices examining ways to change engines in older vehicles to meet Euro 6 emission standards. https://t.co/rN1kZ9j7yq

Further chaos at First Group as head Tim O’Toole resigns after a drop in profits of £327 million in the last financial year. To think that the farcical situation on our railways would be so easily avoidable if profit was longer at the centre of our journeys.
@ClaireLMoran @Crossrail @TfL Went to Chiswick after myself using a combination of the 266 and 440, took me only 20 minutes. In future the journey will be even easier as the 440 will no longer go up Twyford Avenue being instead rerouted to reach North Acton and Willesden Junction via Horn Lane
160+ Parliamentarians of all parties wrote to Sajid Javid asking for action on buffer zones and heard nothing back. Took Guardian's @dansabbagh to break radio silence on Home Office review announced Nov &amp; closed Feb but still nothing concrete promised https://t.co/lkTI8eZ3Dj
Good visit to Old Oak Common @Crossrail depot with @TfL Spoke to drivers, management and even tried hand at operating simulator to Paddington. Project will be transformative for journey times from West London to East https://t.co/7pib93lGIu

@actormanager @TfL TFL are non profit making, and let’s not beat around the bush, they aren’t perfect by any stretch However they are reinvesting revenue in modernising the signalling on the District line, First Group would prefer to make profit than invest in infrastructure if given the choice.
In the capable hands of @loveflamingcow this @ealinghour with @PeterPrickett @MGreer_PR Lots of conversation flowing and #EpicBurgers going like hot cakes https://t.co/uiJYAQt0ic
Just been on the 1912 out of Paddington due to arrive at Ealing Broadway at 1920 didn’t depart until 1931, first group incompetent. Paths allocated poorly if a train running late has to be held to be overtaken by a faster train. Unlike GWR, TFL put passengers first. https://t.co/Tpz8zS5dfj

Pathetic Lib Dums... lobbying birthday boy Corbyn for supposedly siding with Conservatives. Not only WRONG as we’re opposing EU Withdrawal Bill but overlooks how they propped up Tory government contributing to Cameron’s reckless hubristic rush into a disastrous referendum https://t.co/EUOqTIuhtd
Many happy returns of the day Jeremy Corbyn. We’re all older and wiser since this pic in 2015. As a leader you’ve grown in stature and son’s voice broken since &amp; he now towers over me! https://t.co/zsvjsdWdQH https://t.co/qFOgkUJauM

@UWL_LSFMD @uwl_su Yes always happy to, specially on Fridays or Monday mornings. Best to email to fix this up.

Bit strange to describe a Labour landslide in Ealing where we took all time high 57 of 69 council seats &amp; gained councillors in former @EalingTories strongholds as "disappointment".
