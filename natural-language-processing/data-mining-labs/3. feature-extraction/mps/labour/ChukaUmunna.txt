Parties within parties. Broken politics in 2019 https://t.co/tUNlL8dfpu
The national interest dictates that we put party politics aside, and that sensible, decent Ministers like Tobias Ellwood resign and give us their votes to extend Article 50 and stop Britain falling off a cliff in a No Deal Brexit. https://t.co/f9zr8et29n
The government cannot command support for Theresa May's deal, no matter how many times it tries. To avoid falling off the cliff, we need an extension to Article 50 - which is why I voted for the SNP's amendment tonight - and to give the issue back to the people. https://t.co/92gXe5bI5Q
NEW: Due to the Minister‚Äôs promise at the Dispatch Box, at the end of the debate, to publish the relevant papers, @Anna_Soubry will not be putting this to the vote https://t.co/j8STViqVjk
The main reason this Government is not committing to request an Art 50 extension if there is no deal on 29 March is because of the party within a party that is the hard right ERG - it is about time this PM faced them down. https://t.co/Nvm5oES9lE
That was a truly awful performance by the Brexit Secretary just now at the Dispatch Box in the @HouseofCommons

The PM says ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt want no deal you have to vote for a deal‚Äù, in other words her flawed, job destroying deal. This is a lie and she knows it. We can avoid leaving with no deal on 29 March by requesting an extension to the Article 50 process - that is what she must do.
Sitting in the Commons. That statement by the PM was a disgrace. No change. No progress. No plan around which the House could coalesce. All because she won‚Äôt face down the extremists in her party who dictate her https://t.co/6vGO0zkSOD first and the country a poor second.Terrible

So a victim of outrageous racism in @UKLabour must promise she will not walk because of that racism and then this can all go away.

These tests are nonsense + Labour‚Äôs EU policy is all over place.The spirit of Labour‚Äôs conference policy was that if we couldn‚Äôt get an election, referring this back to the people was the way to go -there‚Äôs no sign of that whatsoever. My @Independent piece https://t.co/X2SsjVczBW
And let‚Äôs not forget - the ‚Äúpolitical declaration‚Äù is a declaration of aspiration. By the time the future trading relationship is finalised May will be long gone, new EU leaders will be in place and so on. /4
I hate to think what all those young voters who flocked to the party for the first time in 2017 will make of this. Vote Labour, get a Tory Brexit. They will feel they have been sold down the river. /3
The idea that a PM who sponsored employment tribunal fees, supported weakening unfair dismissal protection and more besides will ensure ‚Äúdynamic alignment on rights and protections‚Äù is utterly laughable. A complete joke. Surely we can do better than this nonsense. /2
This is not Opposition, it is the facilitation of a deal which will make this country poorer. A strong, coherent Labour alternative to this shabby, Tory Brexit is absent - it has been since this Parliament began. Totally demoralising. /1   https://t.co/cRVtopz5Qx

Awful. We cannot allow 2019 to be yet another year blighted by youth violence in our cities. https://t.co/zCjZ9wST6U
A No Deal Brexit would hammer Britain's steel industry to the tune of ¬£70m a year as trade would be ‚Äúseverely disrupted by additional administration, costs and border delays‚Äù, warns UK Steel. https://t.co/ppaFx9XbnJ
It is unsustainable to expect the police to meet the extra demands of increasing serious crime and youth violence when funding remains lower than when the Conservatives took power in 2010. These issues are multifaceted but you cannot expect to tackle them on a shoe string. (5)
What does this mean? Since 2010 London alone has lost 3,000 police officers, 3,000 PCSOs, and 5,000 civilian staff to cuts. Lambeth and Southwark have lost 250 police officers since just 2015. (4)
Grant funding to the Metropolitan Police has also dropped. In 2010, the Metropolitan Police received ¬£2.5 billion in grant money. In 2019-2020, despite the increase in youth violence, the Met will only receive a grant of ¬£1.74bn. (3)
In 2010, Police spending in England and Wales totalled ¬£13.6 billion. After 8 years of the Conservatives in power, that figure for 2019-2020 will only be ¬£12.1 billion. (2)
THREAD: The Government expects praise for a small increase in the Police Grant funding today, but do not be fooled. Their record since 2010 on policing has been highly regressive and has had a significant impact on the ground. (1)
The only people to blame if there's a No Deal Brexit are this government and the Brexiteers who promised the world in the referendum and then walked off the stage when confronted with reality in the negotiations. https://t.co/f39yhTB4hz
New trade deals with non-EU countries will not make up for the loss of trade with our biggest customer, the EU. No matter what changes Theresa May comes back from Brussels with, her deal will be nowhere near as good as the deal we have now as an EU member. https://t.co/5v9Ef5gEbY

Lambeth is the 22nd most deprived local authority area in England - poorer than many areas that voted Leave with more acute social problems.  To discriminate against my constituents when dishing out money, because we voted to Remain, is totally and utterly unacceptable. /3
We don't want to see the pork barrel politics you see in the US sully our politics here. Its bad enough people should want to facilitate a job destroying Brexit deal but to connive in what Downing St is trying to do runs totally against our progressive values. Very Distasteful /2
Government by bung is WRONG - whether involving DUP MPs or those from any other party.  Funding should be based on the needs of the people not on the needs of an incompetent Tory PM to secure the votes of MPs for a deal which will make the UK poorer. /1 https://t.co/wPfCjU6mUO

There is no point claiming you are opposed to a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô Brexit if you are not prepared to will the legal means to stop it happening. Non-binding motions are not the same as legally binding laws. The Cooper and Grieve amendments addressed this. A bad day for Parliament.
The defeats of the Grieve + Cooper amendments are disappointing, but it remains the case that May can't move towards a deal the EU will accept without losing a wing of her party. Parliament needs to take the matter out of her hands if we are to have any hope of avoiding No Deal. https://t.co/SPoQpWeckb
History will not look kindly on those facilitating an economically disastrous ‚Äòno deal‚Äô Brexit. Every serious piece of research shows it will rob people of opportunities and make our country poorer.

4) If we want to detoxify the debate around immigration we must have much more focus in this Bill on better supporting new comers to integrate into the UK as @IntegrationAPPG set out in our ‚Äòintegration not demonisation‚Äô report on immigration here: https://t.co/6P28oeiQrx.
3) The salary threshold of ¬£30,000 for skilled worker visas, proposed by the Govt, presumes those earning less are not ‚Äòhigh skilled‚Äô which is plain wrong.
2) As I‚Äôve argued before we need to reform the way free movement operates - which we can do whilst in the EU - not do away with it altogether as envisaged in the Bill. I explained why in detail here in October 2016: https://t.co/KZMi33AE2S
1) The Bill does not secure the rights of over 1 million UK citizens to live and work in other EU countries and of over 3 million EU citizens to do likewise in the UK.

The amendment is a restatement of an unsustainable policy of keeping options on the table when the country requires leadership. The spirit of our conference motion points to a #PeoplesVote but let‚Äôs not pretend that is policy yet. Nothing has changed and we‚Äôre running out of time https://t.co/QXODQ4yrtk
There is always a flurry of excitement when the frontbench acknowledges the obvious ‚Äì that a People‚Äôs Vote may be the only way forward (it is) ‚Äì but that is not the position adopted by those running the show. Supporting ‚Äúoptions‚Äù is not a credible or sustainable policy./3

And let us not pretend a general request for an extension to Article 50 will be granted. The EU are clear that an extension will be granted for a democratic vote but not for months of more negotiation. We could pass some fuzzy request for an extension but it won‚Äôt be granted.
Of course Parliament must assert itself and impose a process by which MPs decide what course to follow to resolve the gridlock but the core question here is whether Brexit should go ahead at all without the people having a final say - that not process is, in the end, THE issue https://t.co/6ggoo0yPLB
Labour should not be facilitating any form of Brexit but should refer this matter back to the people. Of course Labour should be demanding an Article 50 extension. The time for constructive ambiguity is well and truly over -we are almost out of time to stop no deal. #Marr #Brexit

Shocking research has found appalling discrimination against ethnic minorities in the UK jobs market. It found that BAME people have to send 80% more applications than white Britons before receiving a positive response, a level unchanged since the *1960s*. https://t.co/dfns9wv1Wq

We only formally launched @peoplesvote_uk back in April. The fact that now, after 700,000 marched for it and over 1 million signed a #PeoplesVote @Independent petition, the PM should make this campaign the centre piece of her attack today illustrates that our campaign is working.

Theresa May's agreement satisfies neither people who voted Leave nor people who voted Remain in 2016. With Parliament unable to break the deadlock, we must refer the issue back to the people. @peoplesvote_uk https://t.co/G8e4hCrQ2o
Brexit is the biggest issue in a generation but Parliament is in an impasse. The only way to resolve it is to refer the issue back to the people in a People's Vote. https://t.co/oBEN51vM49
Just delivered the #PeoplesVote #FinalSay petition with over 1 million signatures to No 10 with the ‚Å¶@peoplesvote_uk‚Å© team!  Whether you voted Leave or Remain, no one voted for this mess which is why we need a #PeoplesVote with Remain on the ballot NOW! https://t.co/nqoDodUs1b
There is a huge danger that the moment when parliament could secure a public vote on the deal is lost due to delay and prevarication, denying the people their democratic right to a say over our destiny. We must seize the moment. My @Independent column: https://t.co/hol5O2KeI9
So sad to hear this news. Like so many other Londoners and people around the world, I heard Paul ‚ÄòTrouble‚Äô play out and was never disappointed. He knocked it out of the park with every set.

If the opportunity to put a #PeoplesVote is missed, our country and our younger generations in particular ‚Äì who stand to lose the most ‚Äì will never forgive us.
Others wish to resolve this matter through an early general election but it is clear there is not the requisite two-thirds majority in the House for that proposition either. #PeoplesVote
Many MPs on all sides have indicated privately they will support a people‚Äôs vote if the prime minister‚Äôs ‚Äúdeal‚Äù falls. It is clear the prime minister‚Äôs plan will not command a majority and so that moment is already upon us ‚Äì there is no need to wait and see what is now inevitable
Without the support of the leader of the opposition or the prime minister for such a cross-party move it cannot succeed. But this need not be the case. Parliamentary support grows every day and we will keep making the argument. #PeoplesVote

I‚Äôve said it before, I‚Äôll say it again after the Brexit Agreement is signed off in Brussels: there is no good Brexit-Brexit IS the problem. The Withdrawal Agreement is not in the national interest and will make us poorer.That‚Äôs why we need a #PeoplesVote with Remain on the ballot
üëç https://t.co/BQADfQnBZI
When the guy who negotiated the  Withdrawal Agreement admits it isn‚Äôt as good as the deal we‚Äôve got as a member of the EU, we should vote against this botch job &amp; hand the final decision back to the British people through a #PeoplesVote https://t.co/tXdMHCZy7m
Following the withdrawal agreement and this declaration of aspiration is that the government has agreed to a ¬£40bn divorce bill without a guarantee on our future trading relationship in return. That's why we need a People's Vote. https://t.co/XL1noPGASU
This agreement, because it's not a deal, is a declaration of aspiration and a charter for years of uncertainty. We need a People's Vote. https://t.co/LPC2dYEwnx
This is the best deal that the Gov't can get. Parliament is gridlocked and cannot decide, so it must be for the public in a #PeoplesVote to decide if they accept it or instead want to stay as full members of the #EU, with all the rights that brings, under our current deal. (7/7)
No one voted to be worse off or have less control in 2016 and now the politicians have come back with a proposal that will do just that, we have the right to say no. (6/7)
In short this is a terrible offer to the British people &amp; one that the people should have the opportunity to turn down in favour of keeping our current deal as members with a say over decisions that affect our future. #PeoplesVote (5/7)
‚ÄúThis political declaration is just that ‚Äì a political declaration. It is entirely aspirational and doesn‚Äôt finalise anything. Years of uncertainty and endless negotiations will lie ahead ‚Äì discouraging investment long into the future. (4/7)
We would have to accede to binding rulings from an unelected arbitration panel and, in cases which involved #EU law that would mean accepting the rulings of the European Court: where we would have lost our voice. (3/7) #Brexit
Our economy would be further weakened, the fight against crime &amp; terrorism damaged, &amp; we would be putting environmental, food and safety standards at even greater risk. Not only would Britain lose our voice in key decisions, we would also have to pay into the #EU. (2/7) #Brexit
THREAD: This proposed #Brexit agreement ‚Äì it‚Äôs not even a deal ‚Äì suggests we should hand over power &amp; influence we have as full voting members of the #EU in return for a long list of vague promises. We'll have no substantive say over vital areas of national life.

Just last week, the PM admitted a People‚Äôs Vote was a realistic outcome of this whole sorry mess. As more and more people see the widening gap between what was promised and what this draft Brexit deal actually delivers the support for a #PeoplesVote will grow ever stronger. /3

This amendment, signed by over 70 MPs from 6 political parties, will force the gov't to publish an economic impact assessment of the #WithdrawalAgreement, including a comparison between our current membership of the EU, the proposed withdrawal agreement and no deal. #Brexit
The bottom line is this: a "good #Brexit" plan is a contradiction, as every serious piece of economic research shows. That's why I've tabled a cross-party amendment to the Finance Bill to force ministers to publish a proper economic impact assessment of the #WithdrawalAgreement.

Important: precise quote from the PM‚Äôs statement acknowledging a #PeoplesVote is an option: ‚ÄúWhen you strip away the detail, the choice before us is clear, this deal ....or leave with no deal or no Brexit at all.‚Äù The idea the choice is her deal or no deal was always nonsense.
Most interesting thing about the PM‚Äôs statement - with ‚Äúor even no Brexit‚Äù she acknowledges the @HouseofCommons could provide for a #PeoplesVote enabling the British people to stop #Brexit if they decide the deal we have is better than her deal ie.Brexit is NOT inevitable
This is not in any way shape or form a "deal" in the terms we were promised - it looks nothing like what people voted for and provides no certainty on our final trading relationship with the EU. We need a People's Vote. https://t.co/iZzbsheR2J

You can read more about the work of @YouthViolenceUK, and specific proposals for community-building, investment, and criminal justice reform in my speech for @Demos on youth violence from August here: https://t.co/H3GxZCqwzP (8)
The solution will be community building, that is community led and state supported. This coupled with a multi-agency national programme built around the public health model will transform areas of our cities. Top-down measures are not going to work. (7)
Stopping the violence means preventing young men getting involved in this culture +enabling them to exit it by helping them make new relationships in which dignity depends on inherent sense of self-worth, + ensuring they can use their talents on legitimate means to make money (6)
Boys who are desperate, looking to prove themselves, or are bored by life where they live can be drawn to violence, and the culture of honour and respect that goes with it, but with it is a strong fear of shame and walking away. (5)
I meet mothers and fathers who are towers of strength. But boys and girls need family support and guidance to make their way into adulthood and those that don't have it too often are left to find their own path. (4)
London is a global city but it can be a dark place. It has been set back by a dysfunctional property market, rising rents, Tory austerity, welfare reforms, inequality, and poverty. Families under immense pressure unable to provide for their children with love and care. (3)
There can be no excuse for violence, but it will not end until the social contract between society and young people is restored. We can and we must stop the deaths on our streets. (2)

‚ÄúIt is important to be clear on what we mean by a ‚Äòdeal‚Äô, a term that is used with wild abandon these days and increasingly bears little relation to what we will end up with if Brexit happens.‚Äù - my ‚Å¶@Independent‚Å© column https://t.co/ZusrON9PU0
A Tory minister complained to me that the ERG ‚Äúgenuinely don‚Äôt mind making people poorer because for them it‚Äôs all about ideology‚Äù and conceding that ‚Äúthey are calling all the shots.‚Äù Here's what that means for the Brexit negotiations. https://t.co/ZusrON9PU0
The investigation into Arron Banks and Leave EU is hugely important. It was the largest donation in UK political history, in a referendum that was very close and in which the Electoral Commission found that both Vote Leave +Leave EU cheated.

The ERG talk the talk when it comes to Brexit, but they do not have a majority in the Commons for their vision of a destructive hard Brexit. Here is the proof: https://t.co/v4X1gtXzwy
Jacob Rees-Mogg's ERG claim that technology can solve the Irish border problem. But if they were so sure of themselves, then the backstop they oppose so fiercely would be irrelevant. #PoliticsLive https://t.co/tckbCTeRWR
If there is an impasse in the Commons, the only way to break the deadlock is to do as 700,000 people marching on Saturday called for: a People's Vote on the Brexit deal. #politicslive https://t.co/S56q1ebk3e

The Prime Minister promised in her Lancaster House speech she would "reach an agreement about our future partnership by the time the two year Article 50 process has concluded".

Extending the transition period is just a statement of the obvious, you cannot negotiate a trade deal in 2 years. But the key point is this: the Brexit people were sold is undeliverable, and there is no majority for May's deal in the House of Commons. https://t.co/B01dIShs51

The Progressive Centre UK (which you can follow @UKProgressive), a new think tank and network of progressives ‚Äì which I have been appointed to chair ‚Äì has launched with the explicit aim of connecting progressives from across the UK with the latest ideas and from across the globe.
Meanwhile debate here plays out in two ways: the battle between the hard left and so-called ‚Äúcentrism‚Äù, principally in @UKLabour, too often framed by claimed allegiances to ldrs of another generation; or one that pitches metropolitan, Remain areas against blue-collar Leave areas.
The new generation of progressive politicians recognises times have changed, which means different, modern solutions to today‚Äôs problems.  They are illustrating that ‚Äúmodernising‚Äù does not mean going down a ‚Äúneoliberal‚Äù avenue as some claim.
More and more progressives like @JustinTrudeau @jacindaardern @sanchezcastejon &amp; @EmmanuelMacron are showing it is possible to win, in what some call an age of populism, on a popular progressive platform.
‚ÄúA new generation of politicians is leading the progressive charge internationally. They often get lumped in with the leaders of the past ‚Äìbut the big difference is that their politics has been formed in a post-crash world‚Äù | my ‚Å¶@Independent‚Å© column https://t.co/RerykiHDAr

The more the British people see about this Brexit deal, the angrier they will get. In a way, whether people voted leave or remain doesn‚Äôt matter any more, because we are all being short changed by this travesty. /6
More of what we do know: service industries ‚Äì which make up 80% of our UK economy ‚Äì are getting less than nothing from this deal and are just being cut loose; the issue of the Irish border has still not been fully resolved. /5
What we do know: British taxpayers are being landed with a bill for at least ¬£50bn and will have no say on how that is spent. Manufacturers are going to be hobbled in their biggest market place and there will be no prospect of signing the trade deals the Brexiters promised us. /4
The Brexit elite in Government had one job to do ‚Äì and they said it would be the simplest thing ever: to agree a comprehensive trade deal. It looks very much like they have flunked it. /3
The Brexit elite have decided they can resolve none of the difficult questions and as a result are opting for a blindfold Brexit that will leave us stuck in negotiations and disputes for years to come. /2
Every snippet and semi-substantiated rumour that emerges about a prospective ‚Äòdeal‚Äô only serves to confirm it will be bad for the British people, for British jobs and nothing like the Brexit which was promised. /1 https://t.co/51qlKrJGVG

Because Japan‚Äôs companies are among the biggest inward investors to the UK, employing thousands of Brits, Mr Abe was careful to urge the UK not to crash out of the EU with no deal.Even if we leave with a deal,he said the UK wld lose its role as a gateway to Europe after Brexit./6
We already have trade agreements with over 60 countries ‚Äì including over half the members of the TPP ‚Äì by dint of our membership of the EU‚Äôs customs union, so the idea being part of the TPP could make up for the loss of trade resulting from Brexit is pie in the sky. /5
TPP countries account for less than 8 per cent of UK exports, whereas the EU accounts for almost half. /4
The TPP hasn‚Äôt been ratified yet by and has been thrown into doubt after one of the prospective signatories, the US, pulled out at the instigation of Donald Trump. /3
The UK is on the other side of the world to the TPP Pacific area, whereas the European Union is in our back yard. /2
Japanese PM Shinzo Abe had the increasingly desperate band of Tory Brexiteers jumping for joy today when he said the UK would be welcomed with ‚Äúopen arms‚Äù into the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This is why such joy is misplaced... https://t.co/xkQ1eSmHP7

I have just come out of a meeting to be told the PM danced on to the Tory party conference stage to give her speech to ABBA. I thought it was a joke. It appears not. UK politics in 2018 - a terrible joke.
In the pre briefed extracts of her speech today Theresa May describes the Tories as ‚Äúdecent‚Äù and ‚Äúmoderate.‚Äù That is not how many of her former voters and a number of her MPs see it as I set out in my @Independent column this week. https://t.co/GrGawdeDK4

In fact I believe a damaging hard #Brexit will actually make these problems worse. So many promises from Vote Leave have been broken - where is the ¬£350m extra per week for the NHS?
We know that our country needs fundamental change - I'm not arguing for the status quo. But #Brexit won't answer the problems our country faces - rising house prices, increased #NHS waiting times and a shortage of school places.
Young people and students overwhelming want a #PeoplesVote. Over a million young people who are now old enough to vote, did not get an opportunity at the referendum. It's young people who will bear the heaviest burden of #Brexit, whatever the outcome is.

On their economic record, the Chancellor points to high rates of employment in the Tory‚Äôs defence but ignores the fact that more people are working in insecure work and on zero-hours contracts than ever before, and more than half of people in poverty are in working households.
Here‚Äôs the Latvian Ambassador to the U.K. on @Jeremy_Hunt‚Äôs embarrassing EU/Soviet Union comparison at the Tory party conference. This man is supposed to be our chief diplomat https://t.co/f7ocJJrURN
Jeremy Hunt ‚Äì who voted Remain and called for a People‚Äôs Vote on the final deal afterwards ‚Äì provides the latest example of a low energy, low calibre cabinet seeking votes in the next leadership contest in his Tory Party conference speech yesterday with his silly EU/USSR comments
The present-day Tory party has been working overtime to illustrate that they are both heartless and hopeless, particularly in their handling of Brexit. And at their conference, there also does not appear to be any discernible domestic agenda on show.
Extremism is fashionable in today‚Äôs Tory party. Brandon Lewis criticises antisemitism in Labour whilst ignoring Islamophobia in his own party. As Baroness Warsi has said, ‚ÄúCriticism of antisemitism in the Labour party isn‚Äôt credible as long as we‚Äôve failed to root out hatred.‚Äù
The hard-right, anti-immigrant https://t.co/R6F0KiZBO3 has been encouraging its supporters to join the Tories to influence the forthcoming leadership contest and deselect moderate Tory MPs. It seems to be working.
Past members of the Conservative Party who left to join Ukip are rejoining the party in their droves, and former members of Ukip are making a straight switch to the party.
Due to the small size of the membership, the present-day Tory party is ripe for entryism by the extreme right of British politics. According to numerous Tory MPs this is already happening and is in the process of destroying the delicate balance there was in their party.
Not only is it smaller but the Tory party‚Äôs membership does not come close to looking like modern Britain. Women account for nearly half of Labour party members but less than 30% of the Conservatives, whose members are substantially older than the average Brit.
Organisationally the Conservative Party is in a parlous state. It had more individual members than any other party up to the mid-1990s, when it had about 400,000. Today it has less than a third of that number ‚Äì 124,000 members making it the third party by membership in 2018.
Our two-party system is born out of our unfair, anachronistic electoral system. For it to deliver good government &amp; a healthy democracy, we need both parties to be strong+capable of competently holding each other to account - my ‚Å¶@Independent‚Å© column https://t.co/GrGawdeDK4

#Salzburg further exposes the shambles of #Brexit, the myths that were peddled and the fact there are no easy options. And now those who caused this mess - Johnson, Farage, Grayling and co - try to blame everyone else - but blame lies solely and squarely with them. End of story

"It is clear that we need change at home and abroad. Whatever happens with Brexit, the status quo is not an option." - my @Independent column today https://t.co/KXEf45ad0n
The biggest factor improving the use of stop and search powers in London is the use of body worn cameras by the police - which we campaigned for in #Lambeth. This has led to a big improvement in police interactions and a big fall in the complaints on how it‚Äôs carried out. /5
It is absurd for any police chief to claim there is not a racial dimension to stop and search given the disparities. We cannot duck but must confront these facts. To acknowledge the racial dimension is not to argue for stop and search to be done away with. /4
The Golden Rule ‚Äì that you do not do to others what you would not want done to yourself ‚Äì dictates that stop and search be intelligence led, and is carried out in a way which respects and does not degrade the person subjected to it. This is vital. /3
As I said last month, at the heart of a progressive approach to law+order should be the concept of mutual obligation between society and the individual, and we must observe the Golden Rule: do not do to others what you would not want done to yourself. https://t.co/H3GxZCqwzP. /2
Thread on Stop and Search: #Lambeth, which I represent, has one of the highest rates of stop &amp; search in the country. Stop &amp; search has its place but too often is used in a way which demeans and humiliates young black people in particular./1 https://t.co/RsqAcsd1K0

It would be a real betrayal of trust to deny the people a say on a Brexit deal which is nothing like the one they were promised. It is a betrayal of democracy for the PM to force a bad deal - or no deal - on Britain without giving the public the chance to have a final say. /4

The @YouthViolenceUK interim report is online here: https://t.co/AR7jNbmSZD #StopYouthViolence
"Solutions require national leadership to set a framework. In @YouthViolenceUK interim report we endorse the public health model, based on the @WHO principles of treating violence like a disease - which has been used very successfully in Scotland." #StopYouthViolence
‚ÄúHad there been the political will to act on lessons learned from the 2011 riots, instead of leaving that report on a shelf to gather dust, we would not be seeing the amount of bloodshed on our streets today.   ‚ÄúIt is a damning indictment of British politics.‚Äù #StopYouthViolence
"Most of the solutions to #StopYouthViolence can be found the report into the August 2011 riots. That was a different series of events, involving a wider demographic of people &amp; yet so many of the causes &amp; solutions identified there were the same."
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have a shift &amp; start from the inside and work outward. The solution will be community building is community led. It will be state supported. A multi-agency, national programme to transform the left out areas of our cities." #StopYouthViolence
‚ÄúFar too many of our approaches to tackling youth violence have been top down measures that work from the outside in... imposing so called solutions are not going to work but tick the ministerial and bureaucratic boxes." #StopYouthViolence
"Stopping the killing means preventing young men getting involved in this culture and helping them exit it, by having real opportunities to make connections to the wider world." #StopYouthViolence
‚ÄúSociety has been creating the conditions for this violence and we have been turning our backs on it. Too many of our young people feel disrespected and disenfranchised by society" #StopYouthViolence
‚ÄúWe are all interconnected - no-one is an island. That is why ending youth violence must be a national priority. It is the story this country‚Äôs leaders should be telling.‚Äù #StopYouthViolence
‚ÄúWhat happens in one part of the community or the country, impacts on others. The demand for illegal drugs from well off middle class people is a major driver of this violence. Young people &amp; children are being used to traffic drugs to other parts of Britain" #StopYouthViolence
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs be absolutely clear: this is not simply an issue of black boys killing other black boys in social deprived neighbourhoods. It must not be put into a box as if it only affects one part of society." #StopYouthViolence
‚ÄúInstead of relying on old solutions that don‚Äôt work, we need a paradigm shift in our understanding of serious youth violence and in the action we take to stop it.‚Äù #StopYouthViolence
‚ÄúWe must make ending this violence a national mission. Westminster has failed to do so." #StopYouthViolence
‚ÄúThe job of politicians is to explain what this bloodshed on our streets says about modern Britain; to provide the leadership necessary to galvanise government agencies and others to act; and to put in place policies which will effectively end the violence" #StopYouthViolence
‚ÄúThis violence is a scar on our nation and yet British politics today is incapable of adequately responding to it." #StopYouthViolence

If the Commons is deadlocked on #Brexit - it is -and there is no consensus on how to leave the EU (given Brexit as it was sold by Boris &amp; co is undeliverable), the only option is for the people to decide what happens next. It‚Äôs called democracy and it did not end in June 2016. /2

@GdnPolitics Nothing illustrates the futility of populist right/left responses to the challenges Britain faces right now than the issue of serious youth violence, which is a complex and a very modern phenomenon. I‚Äôll be setting out in detail a different approach in my @Demos speech later.
@GdnPolitics The populism of left and right has reduced politics to simple, black and white, tweetable answers to every problem. One side thinks the answer is to throw money at the problem and pull the levers of state. The other argues for ever tougher sanctions. Both approaches are wrong.
@GdnPolitics Young men and boys involved in knife crime are not innocent victims. They must be responsible for their actions. But there are larger forces at work that can make it harder to do the right thing which we must tackle to end it.
@GdnPolitics Serious youth violence is a scar on our nation, and yet British politics today is incapable of adequately responding to it.
Good to explore how we end serious youth violence with former Police Superintendent @LeroyLogan999 on @GMB - he‚Äôll be responding to my @Demos speech in Brixton later with London‚Äôs Deputy Mayor for policing @SophieKLinden + @NUSuk President Shakira Martin https://t.co/dthUHG7noE https://t.co/ONRvqQ18Dc

PS. To all those questioning the motivations of those calling out racism in the Labour Party, my advice: when in a huge hole, stop digging. These blatant attempts to divert from the issue will not succeed and won‚Äôt rid the party of the disgraceful antisemitism we‚Äôve seen.
Instead of attacking the victims of racism, our values dictate that we stand up for them -that is what I have done. Its shameful the General Secretary of the union of which I am a member should make a personal and political attack against me instead of facing up to this issue. /3

Among the constituencies to switch from Leave to Remain are those of the co leaders of Vote Leave, Boris Johnson (Uxbridge and South Ruislip) and Michael Gove (Surrey Heath). /4 #PeoplesVote
The @BestForBritain analysis, co-produced by @hopenothate, shows this shift to Remain has been driven by doubts among Labour voters who backed Leave. The trend is starkest in the north of England and Wales ‚Äì Labour heartlands in which Brexit sentiment appears to be changing. /3
The @BestForBritain analysis finds that 112 constituencies have switched from Leave to Remain. It suggests there are now 341 seats with majority Remain support, up from 229 seats at the referendum. /2

The Labour Party must now do what its members and supporters and voters are crying out for: put clear red water between the Opposition and the Government, and provide leadership to the country by backing the People's Vote campaign. (5)
This poll shows that Labour voters overwhelmingly support a people's vote, putting them at odds with the party's official pro-Brexit position. (4)
It is clear from YouGov's findings that public opinion is moving behind a people's vote across the political spectrum. (3)
Politicians of all sides are increasingly trapped inside red lines of their own making, but the momentum this summer is with the campaign for a people's vote as more and more people realise it's the only way to take back control of the process. (2)

Labour should under no circumstances be reinforcing the arguments of UKIP and the Tory right when it comes to immigration and supposed 'benefits' of Brexit. (6/6)
To support our manufacturing sector we need a proper industrial strategy which will be severely compromised by failing to secure our place in the Single Market and Customs Union as a bare minimum. (5)
There are minimal benefits from Brexit for the manufacturing sector. Many British manufacturing companies will find their supply chains severed, while the economic hit from Brexit will inevitably mean significant job losses and business closures. (4)
If you accept the populist right's frame as the starting point for a debate on the labour market, they win and progressive values lose. (3)
But we must avoid aping the approach of Trump on the economy. It's a dead end not only as it's wrong but the Tories +UKIP/Farage will always out Trump us if we want to go down the avenue of suggesting the use of immigrant labour is the primary cause of a dysfunctional economy (2)

Our HASC report and the way we engaged with Jewish community groups was praised by the  Board of Deputies of British Jews, the Jewish Leadership Council, The Community Security Trust and others - it is a great shame the party has failed to properly engage with such groups. (6)
Yesterday I wrote to Labour MPs before our PLP meeting to correct misinformation given about that report. My email to colleagues is here: https://t.co/PgPiiHEWj5 (5)
The Home Affairs Select Committee, which I sat on, published a report on antisemitism in 2016 which has been relied on and cited by the NEC. (4)
The Jewish community has clearly been subject to differential treatment by our party these last few years which is discriminatory. Part of the reason I joined the party was because I thought it was anti-racist which is why this horrifies me. (3)
However it is deeply disappointing that despite this strong statement from MPs and an appeal from 68 rabbis from across the Jewish community, the NEC today has not committed to adopting the IHRA definition and examples in full, instead choosing to hold a review. (2)
THREAD: I was pleased when Labour MPs near-unanimously voted to support the IHRA working definition of antisemitism at PLP yesterday. It is a strong signal from MPs that we will not allow antisemitism in our party. (1)

He obviously knows very little about our country https://t.co/1NsJHIJSrQ
Brexiters cry betrayal but no one has betrayed this country more than them. They lied (¬£350m p/w for the NHS?) &amp;they cheated - overspending by 10% when they won in 2016 by 4%. Now they tag team with Trump against their own PM (they want him to bail them out-he won‚Äôt). Shameless.
The PM says President Trump advised her to sue the EU. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd take legal advice from a man whose relationship with the truth is tenuous, who has a disregard for basic human rights and who flouts the rules based liberal international order. #Marr
As things stand, it is likely the Government faces defeat on both the Trade and Customs Bills. Either they change Government policy or there will be a crisis which can only be resolved by Parliament taking back control and imposing a solution. #Marr
There is no majority in Parliament for the Prime Minister‚Äôs Brexit, a Jacob Rees-Mogg ‚Äòhard Brexit‚Äô or a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô Brexit favoured by many of the ERG, but there is a Commons majority for the UK to participate in the EU customs union if some Tory MPs put country before party #Marr
The PM can chant as many times as she likes that her Brexit proposals are a good deal for the UK but she is royally screwing services businesses by leaving them - 80% of our economy - out of her plan. Today‚Äôs Tory party: anti-worker and anti-business. Quite an achievement #Marr

Listening to Jacob Rees-Mogg on @BBCr4today, one can draw only one conclusion: the Tory ERG are working hand in glove with President Trump. Tells you all you need to know about their politics.
Sound on! üîä - As I said on @BBCAnyQuestions last week, I'm no fan of President Trump. I believe he's a racist, an islamaphobe, a misogynist and a pedlar of hatred. #TrumpUKVisit #TrumpVisit
Can‚Äôt believe @Mike_Fabricant tweeted that vile, islamophobic image of @SadiqKhan - thought it was a spoof. He has just deleted it. Describes himself as an ‚ÄúMP dude‚Äù in his twitter profile but is clearly an ‚ÄúMP idiot‚Äù. @SayeedaWarsi is right on this - her party has a problem.
Sound on! üîä - Some have been critical of the #Trump baby balloon but I defend people's right to peacefully protest.

HMG's Brexit White Paper is here https://t.co/cr59Dqonfw. Its the final nail in the coffin to claims that the Tory party are pro-Business - they are the anti-business and anti-worker party whose claims to economic competence have been consigned to the bin.
Its official. The Govt has announced its shafting most of the UK's economy which is 80% services.On "services and digital"  it says four times in its White Paper that as a result of their proposals "the UK and the EU will not have current levels of access to each other‚Äôs markets"

For the hard Brexiteers the PM‚Äôs proposals are simply not hard enough. For those who have argued for a different course altogether ‚Äì like me ‚Äì the notion what the PM is proposing is ‚Äúsoft‚Äù, given it offers nothing for services which make up most of the economy, is fanciful.
Boris Johnson was clearly not suited to the role ‚Äì which requires subtlety and a command of the detail ‚Äì and it showed. Appointing him as Britain‚Äôs top diplomat was always seen as a bit of a joke ‚Äì and ‚Äúa joke‚Äù is a fitting description of his tenure.
Why David Davis was unhappy: no secretary of state wants to be reduced to playing second fiddle to the official who used to report to them.

This from the @Independent‚Äôs @joncstone is rather good.

The problem for DD &amp; the Tory hard right is they have no credible plan on how to avoid breaking up the UK and a hard border in N/Ireland whilst pursuing the extreme Brexit they seek.

The Chequers deal has pleased few with the PM‚Äôs third way: it is NOT a ‚Äòsoft‚Äô Brexit and screws the greatest part of our economy, services, by yanking us out of the EEA/Single Market; for Brexiters like David Davis it isn‚Äôt hard enough. This is why we will need a @peoplesvote_uk.

May‚Äôs proposal is no ‚Äòsoft Brexit‚Äô - it does nothing for services which makes up 80% of our economy, will be rejected by the EU and leaves us with two choices: the UK continues to participate in the Customs Union and Single Market; or a hard Brexit.

The inequality is stark for organ donation too. BAME people wait on average a year longer for a kidney transplant than white people due to higher demand and fewer donations among the BAME community. (5)
For blood donation, 10,000 new Black African Caribbeans with the Ro blood subtype and 17,000 with the negative O blood type need to be found to donate in 2018/19 to meet demand from BAME patients. (4)
Meanwhile, the chance of finding a best possible match for BAME people is 20%. For White Northern Europeans, it is 69%. (3)
Stem Cell Donation: Only 61% of BAME patients find a stem cell transplant donor, compared to 96% of White Northern Europeans. (2)

A 19 year old constituent was stabbed in Dec 2016 and nearly died from his injuries. His mother tried to be moved out of borough but wasn't. He was stabbed again 7 times last week.

Put simply, if a scheme to ensure the rehousing of people across local authorities and housing associations is not made mandatory (it is voluntary at present), young people will continue to lose their lives. Government MUST act. (4)
I am disappointed that the Prime Minister failed to address the issue when I put it to her at PMQs. (3)
It is an outrage that the system is not properly safeguarding teenagers in this situation. We desperately need a nationwide emergency rehousing scheme to protect our young people from such violence. (2)

@gareth_snell @CliveEfford We‚Äôll have to agree to disagree on this. @MikeGapes has written a great piece today on @labourlist about this https://t.co/T2LaC5ohOH
Brexit remains chaotic and shambolic and the Cabinet remains divided. That is why tens of thousands of people will be marching on Saturday for a #PeoplesVote @BBCr4Today https://t.co/tUvvVWkNmx
@CliveEfford Have never suggested otherwise or said we can put all our hopes in any one group. It is a fact that defeating the govt, as we did in December, requires a Tory rebellion to get the numbers to add up in the Commons BUT there are many ways to affect the outcome and win the argument.
The fundamentals of Brexit haven't changed. Brexit is shambolic, Cabinet is chaotic, and Parliament has 5 more Brexit bills it can amend and take meaningful votes on. https://t.co/pgMVStTydV
The chaos and shambles in Westminster on this, the biggest issue facing our country since WW2, underlines why this is too important to be left to 650 MPs - 65million voices must be heard too. Join the @peoplesvote_uk march on Saturday to demand a say. /10 https://t.co/tVLfR304ug
So desperate and disgraceful has this Govt become in its handling of #Brexit that they treated my friend and colleague @NazShahBfd in this appalling way today. Despite this Naz voted on behalf of her constituents. /9 https://t.co/MJba3VvdQO
New facts emerging since the process started make this a very different #Brexit to that promised: ¬£40bn divorce bill with payments till 2064; no 'dividend' for the NHS; loss of EU market access conceded; no new trade deals in place; &amp; more. Today changes none of these things. /8
The EU Council starts on Thursday and these crucial issues are still unresolved: the Irish border and the "backstop'; and UK proposals on the future trading relationship. Cabinet can't agree with itself on these issues nevermind the EU. Nothing has changed (to coin a phrase). /7
...Ministers have acknowledged during the passsge of the #EUWithrawalBill that leaving with ‚Äòno deal‚Äô is inconsistent with Govt policy to avoid a hard Irish border (trading on WTO rules would require a hard Irish border). /6  https://t.co/TTTaKW6jeo
Undoubtedly, the #EUWithdrawalBill has shown that: both main parties have divisions on #Brexit; the Govt is still proposing a hard Brexit that will destroy jobs and harm public services; and,Breixters in Govt - like David Davis - want to keep open leaving with "no deal" BUT.../5
This - providing for continued UK participation in the EU Customs Union - is just one of the cross part amendments down on the Trade Bill which will be a flashpoint when it resumes its passage through the Commons next month. /4 https://t.co/yagyA5pOae
There are still 5 #Brexit related Bills still to make their way through Parliament which are legally binding and amendable: Customs Bill; Trade Bill; Fisheries Bill; Agriculture Bill; and, Immigration Bill. There will also be a huge number of statutory instruments to pass too. /3
Its disappointing the so called "Grieve 2" amendment did not pass this afternoon (I,of course, voted for it) but significant that Ministers were forced to climb down and issue a statement acknowledging Parliament's vital role at the end of the process. /2 https://t.co/TiXGojLe88
THREAD: Today's events in Westminster - which relate to the process and not the substance of Brexit - do not change the fundamental mess and chaos of Brexit. The UK is heading for a bad Brexit deal but its not a done deal - a lot will happen between now and the Autumn. /1
Dominic Grieve will likely be the 3rd speaker in the final #EUWithdrawalBill debate which is about to start. In short,this WMS concedes that Ministers cannot stop a motion -approving the next steps in Brexit this autumn- being amended to provide for whatever path Parl determines
Britain is still heading for a bad Brexit deal but today‚Äôs significant victory shows why it‚Äôs not a done deal. Parliament has reasserted itself and MPs now have the chance to take back control of a botched Brexit process. It is right MPs today have put the country first.
This is the cover letter to the WMS. https://t.co/cX1qqxkRxt

Finally on compensation, although they offered more than the legal requirement, there were lots of issues of customers not getting a level of compensation appropriate to their time without water. It is not acceptable. (6) https://t.co/jplhmEgU1U
Most alarmingly, Thames Water completely let down their vulnerable customers. It "was not able to identify and assist customers in vulnerable circumstances" forcing the Council and volunteers to "fill the gap". (5) https://t.co/LXO9zzOshX
Throughout the crisis, Thames Water failed to communicate or coordinate well with the local council and let its customers down by not communicating with those affected. (4) https://t.co/s8J6mvugex

Incredibly concerning - High Brexit import tariffs and regulatory barriers could cost families over ¬£1,000 each as consumers would pick up the cost of disruption in businesses and supply chains. https://t.co/9elKnXa26k
Terrible front pages for the PM this morning.  When even the Daily Telegraph is not totally buying your Brexit dividend for the NHS lie, you know you are in trouble.  Today‚Äôs @thetimes leader column on the Brexit dividend claim: ‚Äúit is as mendacious as the lie on the big red bus‚Äù https://t.co/JJDodeKwOD
What this is all about is the PM throwing Boris and co some meat to help them out of the hole they dug (with their ¬£350m extra p/w for the NHS lie), in advance of her being forced to concede that Ministers can‚Äôt crash us out of the EU with no deal without Parliamentary approval.
The PM also takes the British people for fools with her claim of an NHS Brexit ‚Äòdividend.‚Äô Govt accepts Brexit weakens the public finances and the divorce bill along with pledges to replace EU funding already uses up our EU contributions for several years. This ain‚Äôt no dividend.
It is even more ludicrous for a PM who lost her majority, has lost her authority and relies on the DUP to have any hope of getting her bills through in a hung Parliament, to come out with this nonsense. It flies in the face of her current political reality.
The more I think about this, the more ridiculous this claim by the PM seems. She clearly does not understand the UK‚Äôs, albeit unwritten, constitution. Parliament acts as a check and balance on the executive, not a rubber stamp. This is not a dictatorship.
Good man! #PeoplesVote https://t.co/slgTGsjjaU
This is simply not true - if the executive can‚Äôt command a majority in the House of Commons, you can‚Äôt govern. It‚Äôs been that way since the last century. It‚Äôs called parliamentary democracy! https://t.co/ExoUSjE9Hn

A prediction for next week: if he hasn‚Äôt already done so, Brexit Secretary @DavidDavisMP will threaten to resign if the PM gives in to the Tory rebels and accepts the UK cannot crash out of the EU with no deal unless Parliament approves it #EUWithdrawalBill
What is going on is very straightforward: the hard right of the Tory party want the Govt to have a passport to crash out of the EU with no deal if Parliament rejects the Brexit deal - the PM, their hostage, doesn‚Äôt have the numbers in the Commons for this #EUWithdrawalBill
NEW: Dominic Grieve‚Äôs ‚Äòmeaningful vote‚Äô amendment as tabled in the Lords by Lord Hailsham. Be in no doubt- if the Govt renege on their promise to adopt its principles, this will pass in the Lords on Monday and we‚Äôll have the numbers to pass it in the Commons afterwards #Simples https://t.co/FYAo276OVb
The simple reality is this: no matter how much the Brextremist minority wishes it were different, there is no majority in Parliament for a destructive ‚Äòno deal‚Äô Brexit. With two thirds of voters now saying the PM is handling Brexit badly, this shows why we need a #PeoplesVote /3
If Ministers are attempting to renege on commitments they made, Parliament must resolve the situation. And if MPs in the PM‚Äôs own party can‚Äôt rely on her to keep her word, then how can our friends and allies in the EU trust any commitments she makes in the negotiations? /2
THREAD: The PM made a solemn commitment that Govt wld accept the substance of Dominic Grieve‚Äôs amendment giving Parliament a meaningful vote at the end of the Brexit process+preventing the catastrophe of a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô Brexit. Now they are trying to row back on that commitment. /1 https://t.co/YT7GngIWfj
My thoughts are with the victims and families affected by the #Grenfell tragedy a year ago today. It is simply unacceptable that so many of those displaced are still waiting to be moved into permanent accommodation. They all deserve far, far better.

The key point from this afternoon's Government climbdown ‚¨áÔ∏è https://t.co/k27zAPygPB
Today, for the first time, Government gave up on its aim to be able to crash the UK out of the EU without a deal if Parliament opposed the one it brought back from Brussels, and accepted the need for Parliament to take back control if it rejects the deal.

So, in his response to me in the Commons just now, @DavidDavisMP admits his proposed fake meaningful vote amendment - which he wishes to replace the real meaningful vote amendment passed by the Lords - will give the Govt a passport to pursue a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô Brexit.
Thanks very much - I've met with lots of people from NI who are gravely concerned about the course #Brexit is taking! https://t.co/cv5U3jkngd
The demand for a People‚Äôs Vote on the final Brexit deal will only grow. With new facts about the consequences of leaving the EU coming to light every day, it is clearer than ever that Brexit is a big deal, but it is not a done deal. (4)
That is why it is so important that principled politicians from all parties, like Dr Phillip Lee, take a stand now and put country before party. History will not be kind to those who choose to shirk our responsibilities and put their careers first. (3)
Brexit will affect generations for generations. Brexit is going badly not just because of incompetence but because it is impossible to deliver in the form it was promised, and it is the people of Britain who will suffer the consequences. (2)
THREAD: The resignation of a Government minister who has immediately gone on to endorse a People‚Äôs Vote on the final Brexit deal is a hugely significant moment. (1)

It‚Äôs also worth reminding these newspapers that the PM lost her majority when she put their desired Brexit to the British people last year. Their front pages conveniently ignore that rather big fact.
These people think they can intimidate and threaten Members of Parliament. These threats, as parliament considers the biggest issue facing us since the Second World War, are a real and present danger to our democracy. This is 2018 not the 1930s.

Most important moment on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill tmr: the vote on this amendment the Brexit Secretary is seeking to add to the Bill to give the Govt a passport to pursue a ‚Äòno deal‚Äô Brexit if Parliament votes against the PM‚Äôs Withdrawal Agreement.

New polling by Opinium shows Labour voters favour staying in the single market after Brexit by a ratio of almost 3:1.  A clear majority of Labour voters in all regions - including those voting Leave - support a Single Market relationship with the EU in the event of Brexit. /8
The Lords EEA amendment has provoked debate on free movement. But, as Gordon Brown set out last week, you can restrict the way the principle of free movement operates to better manage EU migration now whilst we're in the EEA by dint of EU membership. /7 https://t.co/097MMwaJx9
There are MPs this week who will vote against what they believe to be right for the country because of the intimidation and threats they face. These threats, as Parliament considers the biggest issue facing us since WW2, are a real and present danger to our democracy. /6
A number of factors play on Conservative MPs, not least aggressive local associations undergoing increasing entryism from former Ukip members, possible deselection, vile abuse and aggression stoked by some of the Brexit-supporting media, and death threats. /5
If a majority of MPs vote for the Lords amendments, it will vividly illustrate that the ERG‚Äôs vision of Brexit is impossible because the Commons won‚Äôt support it. That will strengthen Theresa May‚Äôs hand in forcing the ERG to face reality. /4
Unless sensible Tory MPs consistently exercise an opposite pressure, the ERG view of the world will win out - they can do this in a less aggressive manner than the ERG, not by threatening to submit 48 letters of their own but by voting for the 15 cross-party Lords amendments. /3
May clearly believes that the ERG members are much more likely than the Tory sensibles to submit those 48 letters from MPs necessary to demand a leadership contest if she turns her back on the hard Brexit they want. /2

Important message from the Leader of @UKLabour's sister party @SDLPlive this evening https://t.co/Q8YQLrA5ys
We have got to ditch our addiction to constructive ambiguity on Brexit.  If you want the benefits of the EEA, you have to back being part of the EEA. End of story.  The UK will have far more influence on EEA rules if we are part of it than if we have 'access' through an FTA.
So, if we are serious about ‚Äòprotecting full access to the internal market of the #EU‚Äô and ensuring ‚Äòno new impediments to trade‚Äô, logic dictates Labour MPs should be whipped to support the cross party #EEA amendment sent to us by the House of Lords. (5/5)
All the way through the passage of this Bill, the only amendments which have commanded support on both sides of the House and passed are cross party backbench ones. (4/5)
...to be part of the framework of protections for workers, consumers and the environment which being part of the European Economic Area uniquely offers to non-EU members. (3/5)
Like the Tory Government and hard-Brexiters this amendment seeks 'access' to the EU's Single Market but this is nowhere near enough. What the overwhelming majority of Labour members and supporters want is so much more...(2/5)
The only way of realising the objectives set out in the amendment, short of EU membership, is through the UK being part of the European Economic Area, as a minimum. (1/5) #Brexit
The only way of achieving the objectives in this amendment - which I support - is for the UK to stay in the European Economic Area.  The only amendments which can command support on both sides of the House are cross party backbench ones like that passed by the Lords on the EEA. https://t.co/FFh8dDDLRU
As the #Brexit negotiations descend into increasing chaos, &amp; as the Gov't continue to make a mess of the process, it simply won‚Äôt do for 650 MPs to determine the fate of 65m people. It should be the people who decide whether the Brexit deal on offer is good enough. #PeoplesVote
More and more momentum is building behind the @peoplesvote_uk campaign, as increasing numbers of organisations, trade unions and other representative bodies add their support to calls for the British people to be given a say on the final #Brexit deal. #PeoplesVote

I've written to IPSA calling for a specific allowance for MPs to pay student placements. I've also called on the Labour Party to establish a fund for placements with Labour MPs. This way, we could continue offering young supporters opportunities while keeping to our principles.
Having listened to the debate the Leeds advert has generated, I have decided not to take on any further university student placements in my office. But I also believe the system must change to allow MPs to take offer paid student placements in their place.
But some have argued that "Years in Industry" are no different from other work, and pointed out that students still amass student debt like other degree years. My own view has been that these placements are an imperfect solution to a wider problem.
LSE have advertised 22 placements funded in the same way as my office in the last year alone, including with Ministers and Labour frontbenchers.
Many MPs have been involved with schemes like these. One University, who I've previously taken students from, have 29 students on their parliamentary scheme this year, 16 of which are BAME.
For the avoidance of doubt, in line with Labour‚Äôs manifesto, I strongly believe that interns should be paid and, for that reason, I do not have any interns working in my office despite the many requests we receive from young people to do so.
These placements are different from internships. Students are with us for between 6 weeks - 7 months. They generally come into the office for up to 2 days a week, and work flexibly. Internships involve regular work hours without support from University or student finance.
Since I was elected, I've accepted placements from a number of Unis, to widen opportunities for young people, help with their studies and ‚Äì above all ‚Äì give them valuable experience that others often only enjoy as a result of family and social connections.
The advert in question was offered by the Leeds University Politics department as part of a sandwich course in which students choose to undertake an additional work placement year - a requirement for their degree. Similar schemes are in place at many Universities.
IPSA, the Parliamentary authority controlling MP's expenses, do not offer additional funding for taking on paid student placements. Like many MPs in London, the sheer volume of casework means that my entire staff budget is used on the salaries of my permanent staff members.

‚ÄúWe need reform of the NHS to avoid a decade of misery‚Äù | this by @leicesterliz @normanlamb &amp; @sarahwollaston is a must read - agree wholeheartedly with them on this https://t.co/k02d3v3edR
Higher taxes are a hard sell any party, but in this instance it is clear that the public understand the need for a larger and more reliable funding stream going into the NHS. To deliver the 4% annual NHS budget rise @TheIFS recommends, there really is no alternative.
I discuss the idea of a hypothecated health tax, wider funding sources like National Insurance, and my own personal and deep debt to the health service. Below is the latest of polling on where the public stand on the issue. https://t.co/Mwvyxl87Od
For too long we have propagated the myth that you can Scandinavian-style public services with American levels of taxation.   In light of yesterday's @TheIFS report, here's my column from January about creating a sustainable and properly-funded NHS.   https://t.co/Mm84v7ltGf
So illustrative of our times https://t.co/eISYghRolz
Very interesting thread https://t.co/bHeCcOaHbZ

Fitting that @jeremycorbyn should rule out a hard border at Queen‚Äôs Uni - their report this week says both communities in NI want ‚Äúfor the UK as a whole to remain in the customs union and single market.‚Äù That means a customs union AND being part of the EEA https://t.co/FpQYI2V0wa
In January I wrote about my support for a hypothecated Health Tax to specifically help fund the NHS, which I believe the majority of people would endorse in return for better services. https://t.co/Mm84v7ltGf
As @TheIFS rightly points out, this kind of money - that amounts to a 4% funding rise a year - can only be raised through taxation. We need a serious debate about what we want the NHS to provide and what we are willing to pay for it. https://t.co/miPIj9Z0v2
Brexit Minister Suella Braverman used to claim we wouldn't have to pay a Brexit Divorce bill.  Now she's admitting that not only will we pay it, there's no guarantee of a trade deal after. This is why so many are calling for a #PeoplesVote. Pls RT: https://t.co/ssOFXYFsMx

Yesterday I told Government that the #SeriousViolenceStrategy needs to start with a public health approach, with a strong focus on the mental health of our young people. We are not looking after the health and well-being of too many of our young people in deprived communities. https://t.co/VsbwUl05gn
Absolutely right from GMB General Secretary @Tim_Roache on the real Brexit cost to families that Theresa May would rather ignore. https://t.co/ARghCB79GB
.@KateOsamor and I had such a laugh recording our latest takeover of @MiSoulTweets. Some excellent tunes! We're on this bank holiday Monday, 7-9pm with the best of #funk, #soul and #hiphop. Join us! üéôÔ∏èüéµüé∂üìª https://t.co/ZuLdjpQyd8
Youth Violence is a serious issue that politicians are often seen as only talking about when it comes up in the news. It requires cross-party working, and joined up action across Government Departments, our communities, and civil society. Here are my thoughts from this afternoon. https://t.co/cHcqyMmLrU
.@KateOsamor and I are taking over @MiSoulTweets again this bank holiday Monday, 7-9pm. Join us for the best in #funk #soul and #hiphop. We'll be online and on DAB: https://t.co/ReOIUtSItx #Streatham #Edmonton https://t.co/0Z2pE0ilxU
We need to start dealing with serious Youth Violence with a public health approach as the only way to deal with the link between deprivation, poverty and youth violence. https://t.co/usoeAI4qTc
MUST-WATCH: Mark Carney, Bank of England Governor, reveals today that households are already ¬£900 worse off than forecast.  Brexit is already costing every person in this country hundreds of pounds in lower income, and we haven‚Äôt even left yet. Please RT: https://t.co/YQQVkJwR2y
The reality of Brexit, and this is before we have even left. #PeoplesVote https://t.co/7iI7pGhZHU
Whisperings in Westminster tell me that both parties are about to change their Brexit strategies. My column for the @Independent this week. https://t.co/rxYRhul7th
.@Independent: "Bereaved Grenfell relatives unable to attend start of public inquiry due to Home Office visa delays." - I simply do not understand how the Home Office could have allowed this to happen - it is so utterly cruel and so disgraceful. https://t.co/i46NhplvGm
Behind the scenes, things are moving in both main parties when it comes to Brexit. Here's what it means. @Independent https://t.co/rxYRhul7th
