I’ve written a little more about the historical precedent set by William Gladstone when he called an election after seeing his flagship legislation on the government of Ireland defeated by just 30 votes in 1886: https://t.co/flVz1WlB4z https://t.co/1lgpCbsQBK
Theresa May didn't just lose this vote by 200 more than Gladstone (230 vs 30), but with 25 more of her own MPs rebelling against her than rebelled against him (118 vs 93). If she has any sense of honour, she must follow his lead and call an election.
In 1886, Gladstone lost the vote on his Home Rule Bill by 30 votes, and felt obliged to call an election as a result. For Theresa May to do anything otherwise after the scale of this defeat would be utter cowardice. A reminder of my @Guardian article: https://t.co/kBzOSIuJNR

Yemen is facing a horrific man-made famine, threatening the lives of millions, and yet the man most culpable is apparently giving orders to our government on whether his alleged war crimes should be investigated. My new article for the @Guardian: https://t.co/RTz5nLJy4m
I've just written to Jeremy Hunt asking a number of questions about the UK's draft UN resolution on Yemen, most importantly the one he refused to answer earlier in the House on whether Saudi Crown Prince Salman ordered him to remove a call for the investigation of war crimes. https://t.co/WrEs7WGzIp
The UAE are supposed to be allies of Britain, and yet they have given a life sentence to one of our citizens, Matthew Hedges, for spying. It  is unproven, unjust and gravely worrying.
In the Commons earlier, I asked Jeremy Hunt why the UK's draft UN resolution on Yemen contains no call for the investigation of alleged war crimes, and whether it was the Saudi Crown Prince who demanded that point was taken out. I got no answer. But I'm going to keep asking. https://t.co/r0hg1NFkgq
@JamesCleverly I’d obviously never accuse you of misleading Parliament, but misleading your Twitter followers is quite another thing.

@GwynneMP 🤦‍♀️
And to prove the point, depressing and wrong that – for the second time this month – the Foreign Secretary has made a major speech, and said not a single word about Yemen, Saudi Arabia, the Iran Nuclear Deal, Israel, Palestine, Cameroon, Myanmar, Climate Change or Human Rights.
Depressing and wrong that – in his desire to appoint business leaders to our ambassador roles around the world – he is admitting that under this government, the only role of diplomacy post-Brexit is promoting trade. Nothing else matters.
Depressing and wrong that a Foreign Office already demoralised by Brexit, by austerity cuts, and by Boris Johnson’s reign of torpor has now been told by the new boss that its senior staff aren’t fit to do its most important jobs representing Britain overseas.
I wanted to wait today and see if Jeremy Hunt’s full speech to Policy Exchange was an improvement on the overnight briefing. But if anything, it was worse. And I’ve got two words to sum it up: Depressing and Wrong.
We remain deeply concerned about the political crisis in Sri Lanka. The constitution must be respected. True peace and justice in Sri Lanka is only possible if there is accountability for war crimes and human rights abuses.

And the only mention of Donald Trump was Jeremy Hunt reassuring us that they’d enjoyed a ‘manly handshake’. Good for you, Jeremy, but I’d rather know whether you stood up for British values when you met him. If not, don’t dare lecture the Labour Party about patriotism.
And not a single word from any of them in their 'international session' either about Climate Change, Human Rights, the Iran Nuclear Deal, Cameroon, Israel and Palestine, Myanmar or the Rohingya. This is a Tory Party obsessed with leadership bids, not global challenges.
In their so-called ‘beauty contest’ today, there was not a single word from either Jeremy Hunt, Gavin Williamson, or Penny Mordaunt about Yemen, and Britain’s role in fuelling the war and the resulting humanitarian crisis. I know I shouldn’t be surprised, but I am disgusted.

@Deleuzeghost @LabourStudents @DaniRowley Well I was playing disco music and it all seemed fine💃🕺💃🕺
Home after a really successful #Lab2018 conference. Just seen this and it made me smile: a photo of me DJing at @LabourStudents disco - with @DaniRowley taking her duties as PPS very seriously.  https://t.co/2aN0fglelp
In which - amongst other things - I heartily recommend a visit to the amazing People's History Museum in Manchester, with its lovely team of staff. Thanks for a great experience, @PHMMcr.
Here's my @NewStatesman diary of a busy week in Westminster, but a bittersweet one at home, after our last bird flew the nest. https://t.co/M4TpU3iCkv
For their Conference edition, @Politics1st asked me if Labour can achieve an ethical foreign policy. And I answered that - if we want to live up to @JeremyCorbyn's principles and meet the challenge Nelson Mandela set us 18 years ago - how can we not? Read my full article here. https://t.co/CasLDI7CEj

This, from @DailyMailUK and not a sneering word in sight!!!&gt;&gt; https://t.co/uHKIsILIOJ
We heard the new Home Secretary make a big play of changing the culture in the Home Office, and that was what the PM fell back on today, but she needs to order the DWP to do the same, and pro-actively investigate all benefits decisions made in relation to Windrush citizens.
Another Windrush constituent of mine had his benefits stopped last year when being reassessed for Employment Support Allowance, because he had no proof of UK status. Thankfully we got that decision reversed, but it shouldn’t be down to MPs. The DWP must revisit all these cases.
If you wondered what this was about, I was challenging the PM over the DWP’s scandalous treatment of Windrush citizens, including one of my constituents, who couldn’t prove her status, lost her job as a result, and is now being denied contributory benefits. That is plain wrong. https://t.co/W19LuLCocP
The EU rightly censured the Hungarian Government for attacking political freedom, equality, the rule of law, and the human rights of migrants. Tory MEPs tried to protect them, thankfully they failed, but talk about showing their true colours...https://t.co/xxetR6c4GX
In the House earlier, I struggled with my emotions talking about one father's account of losing his boys in August’s Saudi air strike on a school bus in Yemen. But we owe it to them and the thousands of other civilians killed to continue speaking up. https://t.co/pApUuhftNO
In the Commons today, I said that - if there are reports of a chemical weapons attack in Idlib over the coming weeks - the government must ensure the reports are independently verified and that Parliament has given its approval, before escalating British involvement in the war. https://t.co/IRtBzwmjY3
There it is &gt;&gt; https://t.co/ivcrRXSTz5
Yesterday, in a Commons debate on the Tory vision of 'Global Britain', I talked about the reality of what it means: no morals, no values, no ethics; just selling British business to the highest bidder, no matter who they are. https://t.co/bgJq1O4Ctz
@OwenJones84 @BBCr4today We are waiting by our radios.... Where's Owen?

@PennyRed could u follow me so I can DM you?
Once again, the inspectors confirm what I've been saying for years. It doesn't matter how hard the prison staff work, they cannot keep Pentonville clean, safe and humane because that antiquated building was simply not built to house this many men. https://t.co/1ejViQqVB2

Not many will leave as great a legacy of achievements as #KofiAnnan, but we must now add to it by enacting his 2017 plan to bring lasting peace, justice and prosperity to the Rohingya people. That would be a more fitting tribute to his memory than any mere words of praise today.

Great honour to be representing The Labour Party at Westminster Abbey on Nelson Mandela's 100th Birthday, where a memorial to the great man was dedicated. #Mandela100 https://t.co/pBFgiPxIdh
When their Chair @BrandonLewis double-crosses a pregnant MP like this, the Tories show just how ruthless &amp; desperate they are to hold onto power. Disgraceful https://t.co/hxYIiSTACT
Even more pathetically predictable, in an assessment of the state of human rights in the world in 2017, the FCO doesn't see fit to mention once the impact of Trump's election, his Muslim travel ban, and the free pass he has given to human rights abusers across the globe.
A staggering omission from yesterday’s annual FCO Human Rights report: not a single mention in its Yemen section of the Saudi-led coalition, its air strikes and blockade. It talks about civilian casualties but doesn't identify the main party responsible! https://t.co/8dBthgc56W

At PMQs earlier, ahead of tonight's big match, I told the government they could learn a thing or two from watching Gareth Southgate's England team. https://t.co/dhGgVWm0uc
Donald Trump describes his relationships with Boris Johnson and Theresa May as “very nice”. And on Climate Change, Human Rights, Palestine, Iran and Tariff Policy, where exactly has being “very nice” to Trump got them? Pathetic.
Government resignations since autumn: 1 November 2017 - Fallon 8 November 2017 - Patel 20 December 2017 - Green 29 April 2018 - Rudd  8 January 2018 - Greening 8 July 2018 - Davis There have been six resignations in 249 days. That’s one every six weeks

I asked the government today why, instead of an independent UN inquiry into the Gaza violence, they want to let Israel investigate itself. https://t.co/ba78r1eM5a
I'm delighted by the UN's Human Rights Council resolution calling for an urgent independent investigation of Monday's massacre in Gaza, but disgusted that the UK government abstained.
There must be an independent investigation of the Gaza massacre, and those responsible must be held to account. My Commons statement today: https://t.co/ig7c3bXg0j

Also @eddiemair, you asked me about our pledge to end mixed-sex wards. Any reason you didn’t ask Gove why the Tories have ditched theirs?
Hi @eddiemair, did I miss the bit where you asked Michael Gove what broadband speeds the Tories are planning to deliver?
#Torymanifesto 9 AND this &gt;&gt; https://t.co/tI4WHvtUXw
8. Always check the small print: the #torymanifesto says no increase in level of VAT, but doesn't pledge to keep zero rates on food, etc.
#Torymanifesto 7: Cameron's 2015 'tax lock' explicitly pledged 'no extension in scope of VAT'. Why has this been ditched in 2017?
#Torymanifesto 6  Labour's pledged to protect VAT zero rates on food, children's clothing, books, public transport. Why won't the Tories?
#Torymanifesto 5: I see the commitment in 2015 to increase number of female MPs has been quietly ditched this time round
#Torymanifesto 4 In the equivalent section of 2015 manifesto, I count 24 different countries that were discussed. Talk about turning inwards
#Torymanifesto 3 And in their 1st manifesto since attacks in Tunisia, Paris, Nice, Brussels, Westminster &amp; elsewhere, no mention of Daesh.
#torymanifesto 2 No mention of Israel-Palestine. Nothing on Russia, China and North Korea. No Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq or Yemen.
The only country mentioned by name in 'Global Britain' section of the #Torymanifesto is the United States. That tells you everything.
