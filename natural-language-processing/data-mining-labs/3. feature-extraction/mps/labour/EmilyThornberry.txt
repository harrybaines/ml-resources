I‚Äôve written a little more about the historical precedent set by William Gladstone when he called an election after seeing his flagship legislation on the government of Ireland defeated by just 30 votes in 1886: https://t.co/flVz1WlB4z https://t.co/1lgpCbsQBK
Theresa May didn't just lose this vote by 200 more than Gladstone (230 vs 30), but with 25 more of her own MPs rebelling against her than rebelled against him (118 vs 93). If she has any sense of honour, she must follow his lead and call an election.
In 1886, Gladstone lost the vote on his Home Rule Bill by 30 votes, and felt obliged to call an election as a result. For Theresa May to do anything otherwise after the scale of this defeat would be utter cowardice. A reminder of my @Guardian article: https://t.co/kBzOSIuJNR

Yemen is facing a horrific man-made famine, threatening the lives of millions, and yet the man most culpable is apparently giving orders to our government on whether his alleged war crimes should be investigated. My new article for the @Guardian: https://t.co/RTz5nLJy4m
I've just written to Jeremy Hunt asking a number of questions about the UK's draft UN resolution on Yemen, most importantly the one he refused to answer earlier in the House on whether Saudi Crown Prince Salman ordered him to remove a call for the investigation of war crimes. https://t.co/WrEs7WGzIp
The UAE are supposed to be allies of Britain, and yet they have given a life sentence to one of our citizens, Matthew Hedges, for spying. It  is unproven, unjust and gravely worrying.
In the Commons earlier, I asked Jeremy Hunt why the UK's draft UN resolution on Yemen contains no call for the investigation of alleged war crimes, and whether it was the Saudi Crown Prince who demanded that point was taken out. I got no answer. But I'm going to keep asking. https://t.co/r0hg1NFkgq

And to prove the point, depressing and wrong that ‚Äì for the second time this month ‚Äì the Foreign Secretary has made a major speech, and said not a single word about Yemen, Saudi Arabia, the Iran Nuclear Deal, Israel, Palestine, Cameroon, Myanmar, Climate Change or Human Rights.
Depressing and wrong that ‚Äì in his desire to appoint business leaders to our ambassador roles around the world ‚Äì he is admitting that under this government, the only role of diplomacy post-Brexit is promoting trade. Nothing else matters.
Depressing and wrong that a Foreign Office already demoralised by Brexit, by austerity cuts, and by Boris Johnson‚Äôs reign of torpor has now been told by the new boss that its senior staff aren‚Äôt fit to do its most important jobs representing Britain overseas.
I wanted to wait today and see if Jeremy Hunt‚Äôs full speech to Policy Exchange was an improvement on the overnight briefing. But if anything, it was worse. And I‚Äôve got two words to sum it up: Depressing and Wrong.

@angelaissa66 @eRecruitSmart @evolvepolitics I think I talk about this in some depth in the Mat Chorley interview at Conference. Link is on my timeline
And the only mention of Donald Trump was Jeremy Hunt reassuring us that they‚Äôd enjoyed a ‚Äòmanly handshake‚Äô. Good for you, Jeremy, but I‚Äôd rather know whether you stood up for British values when you met him. If not, don‚Äôt dare lecture the Labour Party about patriotism.
And not a single word from any of them in their 'international session' either about Climate Change, Human Rights, the Iran Nuclear Deal, Cameroon, Israel and Palestine, Myanmar or the Rohingya. This is a Tory Party obsessed with leadership bids, not global challenges.
In their so-called ‚Äòbeauty contest‚Äô today, there was not a single word from either Jeremy Hunt, Gavin Williamson, or Penny Mordaunt about Yemen, and Britain‚Äôs role in fuelling the war and the resulting humanitarian crisis. I know I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised, but I am disgusted.

We heard the new Home Secretary make a big play of changing the culture in the Home Office, and that was what the PM fell back on today, but she needs to order the DWP to do the same, and pro-actively investigate all benefits decisions made in relation to Windrush citizens.
Another Windrush constituent of mine had his benefits stopped last year when being reassessed for Employment Support Allowance, because he had no proof of UK status. Thankfully we got that decision reversed, but it shouldn‚Äôt be down to MPs. The DWP must revisit all these cases.
If you wondered what this was about, I was challenging the PM over the DWP‚Äôs scandalous treatment of Windrush citizens, including one of my constituents, who couldn‚Äôt prove her status, lost her job as a result, and is now being denied contributory benefits. That is plain wrong. https://t.co/W19LuLCocP

Even more pathetically predictable, in an assessment of the state of human rights in the world in 2017, the FCO doesn't see fit to mention once the impact of Trump's election, his Muslim travel ban, and the free pass he has given to human rights abusers across the globe.
A staggering omission from yesterday‚Äôs annual FCO Human Rights report: not a single mention in its Yemen section of the Saudi-led coalition, its air strikes and blockade. It talks about civilian casualties but doesn't identify the main party responsible! https://t.co/8dBthgc56W

#Torymanifesto 9 AND this &gt;&gt; https://t.co/tI4WHvtUXw
8. Always check the small print: the #torymanifesto says no increase in level of VAT, but doesn't pledge to keep zero rates on food, etc.
#Torymanifesto 7: Cameron's 2015 'tax lock' explicitly¬†pledged 'no extension in scope of VAT'. Why has this been ditched in 2017?
#Torymanifesto 6  Labour's pledged to protect VAT zero rates on food, children's clothing, books, public transport. Why won't the Tories?
#Torymanifesto 5: I see the commitment in 2015 to increase number of female MPs has been quietly ditched this time round
#Torymanifesto 4 In the equivalent section of 2015 manifesto, I count 24 different countries that were discussed. Talk about turning inwards
#Torymanifesto 3 And in their 1st manifesto since attacks in Tunisia, Paris, Nice, Brussels, Westminster &amp; elsewhere, no mention of Daesh.
#torymanifesto 2 No mention of Israel-Palestine. Nothing on Russia, China and North Korea. No Syria, Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq or Yemen.
The only country mentioned by name in 'Global Britain' section of the #Torymanifesto is the United States. That tells you everything.
