Few individuals have shown contempt for our Parliamentary democracy in the way Mark Zuckerberg has. If one thing is uniting politicians of all colours during this difficult time for our country, it is our determination to bring him and his company into line.
We need new independent regulation with a tough powers and sanctions regime to curb the worst excesses of surveillance capitalism and the forces trying to use technology to subvert our democracy.
Labour agrees with the committee‚Äôs ultimate conclusion: the era of self-regulation for tech companies must end immediately.

We are living in a digital dystopia. But we can still harness the power of digital to enhance our democracy and our lives. Our task is to steer the power of technology back towards the public interest. #ProgressiveUKTech https://t.co/5YznkIDQV8
Encourage/shape a public sphere of where citizens can absorb credible news and information safe in the knowledge they will not be surveilled or targeted with ads when they do.
Fix a distorted online market caused by data monopolists and tech acquisitions. This requires a regulator to stop the lobbyists and lawyers jumping through the cracks in law and the gaps in our knowledge.
We will deal with social harms, hate and fake news by placing an enforceable legal duty of care on social media companies to protect children and empower consumers, backed by a powerful new regulator.
Technology responds to the desires of its users, the structure of its market, and to the limits of the law. These things can all be changed. We can‚Äôt afford a laissez faire approach to digital regulation any longer.
The digital market is broken. Monopolistic power, wielded by a tiny number of companies, is causing serious social harm; and subverting our democracy.

@Nick_Pettigrew @PeoplesMomentum Firstly, I never called him a hero. And secondly, though likely, it was never proven that he killed Nancy.

Children coming from lower socioeconomic families are almost twice as likely to have decay, and more likely to experience toothache, to have difficulty in finding an NHS dentist, and to report problems in their daily life cause by their oral health.
Removal of multiple decayed teeth remains the most common reason for a 5-9 year old child being admitted to hospital in England, and more than ¬£50m a year is spent on tooth extractions on under 19s.
The @bspduk points out that 16 per cent of 12 year olds say they have sugary drinks more than four times a day; and 12 per cent of 3 year olds have visible tooth decay.
It was sent to me the British Society of Paediatric Dentistry, with a note saying that "Dental decay is almost always preventable."

And if the advertising industry can't find a way to do it, I promise you the next Labour government will.
So when it comes to high sugar products like Coco Pops, my message is simple: get that monkey off our packs. Get cartoon characters off adverts for high sugar products.
The unpalatable truth for the Advertising Association, which represent the interests of the industry to government, is that some sectors of the advertising industry have played a part in getting us here.
...and the catastrophe of Type 2 diabetes, taking lives, and costing the NHS ¬£10 billion a year. I'm making it my political mission to change this.
We face a public health crisis in the UK, and one of the main causes is refined sugar in our food and drink. The results are horrific. 26,000 children hospitalised with rotten teeth. The worst obesity rates in western Europe...
Here are some current examples of what I would call irresponsible advertising. Before anyone tells me this is packaging not advertising, let me tell you what they are: billboards on table tops aimed at tiny tots. https://t.co/YStCOW5nqf
These adverts look appalling to us today, but I wonder which of today's ads and promotions for sugary food and drinks will seem as horrible to future generations.
Looking through historical adverts and judging them through contemporary cultural values is not particularly productive. But they help illustrate how important it is that what is said is accurate, proportionate and truthful. https://t.co/7lMbmICNGo

"The Rt Hon Lady will be forever known as the 'nothing has changed Prime Minister'. But something must change." Watch my 'No Confidence in the Prime Minister' speech by clicking on the link below.  https://t.co/axfNIn48lC
As @JeremyCorbyn has made absolutely clear in his letter to the PM today, her deal is now dead. She must take No Deal off the table, ditch her red lines and get serious about alternative Brexit options. Something must change. https://t.co/NJcjV4QzVN
"The Rt Hon Lady will be forever known as the 'nothing has changed Prime Minister'. The truth is she is too set in her ways, too aloof to lead. She lacks the imagination and agility to bring people with her. She lacks the authority on the world stage. Ultimately she has failed." https://t.co/NFdiVQfNL5
Instead of brazenly breaking their manifesto promise to maintain the free TV licence, the Tories should take back responsibility from the BBC, and for once....do the right thing.
Two-in-five over 75s should be on pension credit, but aren't. Many don't know they are eligible, others won't claim because of stigma, say @IndependentAge. Means-testing the TV licence will strike at millions of the poorest and most vulnerable. https://t.co/pqzM2qHg8t
In a week that has brought fresh revelations about gambling firms's failure to support addicts who want to self-exclude, this powerful story serves as a reminder that if the industry doesn't put its own house in order, then politicians must do so instead. https://t.co/QynqRZJ6D0
Tonight by 432 votes to 202, the PM has suffered the biggest defeat in the House of Commons in over 100 years. She is devoid of authority in the Commons, in the country, and even within her own party. She should call an immediate General Election. https://t.co/ndk36n3pxy
@Steve_J_I Hah! I‚Äôve been mainly trying to work out how an airlock works when the doors have key holes.
The Attorney General is demonstrating his expertise in sucking air from a room, like an air lock, if I may use that metaphor.
As the PM hosts Cabinet, I hope she, they, and others who sat in those chairs over the last 30-odd months, waging the same battles the Tories have fought over the last 30-odd years, reflect on how their ruinous internecine wars have let our country down. https://t.co/d78uGAoetl

@Dr_Ellie I think you should be a bit more ambitious for your patients. They need greater choices.
@Dr_Ellie I think the masses should have choices and I admire the people who are disrupting the food supply chain to fight back against processed food stuffed full of cheap oils and sugars. Now that I‚Äôve lost 100 pounds and feel fantastic, I feel it‚Äôs my duty to shake the tree a little.

Have confidence: 200 Against: 117 After 40 years tearing itself apart over Europe, tonight's vote shows the Tory party is finally and irrevocably split in two. It is incapable of agreeing a Brexit deal and unfit to govern. There is no pathway back. We need an election.

The Secretary of State has only been in post for 134 days. In that time he has overseen the resignation of a respected minister, he has made a humiliating policy climb-down on FOBTs and ignored the inevitable crisis in local news which has come with Johnston Press's collapse.
Even Rupert Murdoch showed greater respect for our democratic institutions than Mark Zuckerberg, who refused to appear before our DCMS Select Committee.
Whilst Ministers prevaricate, the tech oligopolies have consolidated their market advantage by dominating digital ad revenues. They avoid fair taxes and will pay less once the Government‚Äôs Corporation Tax cuts are introduced. Some have even allowed criminal data breaches.
For 10 years we have seen the impact of digital disruption on local journalism with hundreds of newspapers closing. Yet after 8 years of Tory government all we hear is the Secretary of State referring to a process which they currently articulate as the Cairncross Review.
The collapse of Johnston Press is an inevitable crisis for local newspapers that everyone knew was coming. But it's been ignored by DCMS Secretary Jeremy Wright. After 134 days in post he needs to wake up and stop sleeping on the job. My Urgent Question in the House. https://t.co/ObPYZhVx9P

@jongaunt @Conservatives @CocaCola @premierleague @tateandlyleplc @DrAseemMalhotra @LegacyGuyUK @Simpleasfat I think Coca Cola are contributing to our children‚Äôs ill health with the amount of sugar they put in their products. How they can sell cans of coke that have more sugar than the government‚Äôs Recommended Daily Allowance for adults beggars belief.
@BeardofScotland Can you give me a few links that point to this?
@matthewgriggst2 @8WeekBloodSugar @DrAseemMalhotra @RobertLustigMD Someone in another thread said they‚Äôd rather know the oils used in the food preparation. That would help me more too.
@allanlambert There were many but giving up refined sugar in all its forms was key. Making time to prepare real food not the processed stuff was also vital.

I've been informed a pairing breach took place in 1977, similar to last week's Brexit votes. Then Callaghan and Thatcher agreed to re-run the crucial vote to uphold trust in Parliament. It is now incumbent on Theresa May to do the same. Full statement: https://t.co/BXIbwAITgq

The Sun newspaper now claims Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith asked up to FIVE MPs to break their pairing promises. If this is proven it shows how duplicitous and shifty he is.¬†  Someone is lying here. Either the Chief Whip resigns or the Prime Minister is tainted by his disgrace.
This is what happens when you dismantle the fabric of our society through austerity while slashing the number of police on our streets.  The Tory party, which once made claim to be the party of law and order, is now the party of crime and disorder.  https://t.co/VeCaNBQZiI
Tory chief whip told three MPs to defy "pairing" deals on crucial Brexit votes according to today's Times. If true, this is despicable behaviour which makes politics even more inaccessible for women.   If true, Julian Smith must resign, or be sacked.  https://t.co/ysKYWZNadQ

@jayrayner1 Firstly, I was officially paired. Secondly,  and rather urgently at the time, I was having a gaping wound in my arm treated in hospital. If I hadn‚Äôt been paired I would have risked bleeding to death at the vote. Hope this helps Mr R.
Theresa May is so scared of the plotting, treachery and resignations of her own right wing that she is now planning to send her MPs home early.  The quote "in office but not in power" has never seemed more apt. I shall be opposing the vote to shut down the Commons early. https://t.co/2V25utaPW1

@thevicarswife @ExperiMentalUK @foodallergyuk @lis_wad I‚Äôm not a qualified dietician but as an enthusiastic amateur it strikes me that comparing lactose to cane sugar is nonsensical.

@SpeyeJoe What's the matter with that?
@SpeyeJoe Genuinely fascinated by your interpretation of the St George's flag.
@TenPercent More celebrating St George's day, England's patron saint.
@tashLDN I'm sorry you feel that way. I'm very proud to celebrate England's patron saint today.

@joev4ughan You're not a fan of Brian Patten?
@JonathanPlaid Can I ask what you meant by "showing true colours'? It seemed to me you were condemning me for supporting my country's Patron Saint.
@PJPollockVet I've often celebrated St Andrew's day with friends. Why do you object to me marking St George's day in England?
@LYNNMILDNER @labour @UKIP Please explain why celebrating the  the Patron Saint of England is a problem to you?
@JonathanPlaid You do know it's St George's day?
