Environment Sec admits tariffs on food &amp; border delays if we end up with No Deal. That means higher food prices in shops. ERG MPs who are arguing for No Deal aren’t the ones who will suffer, but overstretched families will. https://t.co/jrDYS0Pswb

That’s why cross-party MPs will come together next week to put forward a Bill to prevent the Prime Minister leaving everything til the last minute and taking us over the cliff-edge by accident. Responsible ministers need to join us and say No to No Deal 5/
The most basic responsibility of Government is to keep the country safe. No Deal will make that more difficult. What kind of Government would do that when it could be avoided? 4/
All of this shows why the top counter-terror police officer in the country has warned that No Deal would mean a ‘very serious flaw’ in our security arrangements 3/

If PM has not secured support for a Deal by 26 Feb, then we will table a cross party amendment that week in order to make time for the Bill &amp; to get a common sense safeguard in place
Bill is sponsored by @oletwinofficial @normanlamb @spelmanc @hilarybennmp @NickBoles @JackDromeyMP,  Dominic Grieve MP,  @StewartHosieSNP,  @BenMLake @leicesterliz @CliveEfford

“We will have to replace some of the things we currently use in terms of access to databases, the way in which we can quickly extradite and arrest people … but it will be more costly, slower and potentially put [the] public at risk” Met Commissioner Cressida Dick 27 Dec
“If we have no-deal Brexit, and we could not share that information, and if we lose access to those systems, it will inevitably make the UK and Europe less safe than it is today.” DAC Neil Basu, UK counter terror lead, 23 Jan

Commons has voted tonight against No Deal, tho there was not the support this evening for a legislative safeguard. I’m still very worried that PM does not have a workable plan to prevent a cliff edge at end of March. She needs to show by next vote in Feb what has changed https://t.co/DgSiLzCaek

Met NHS bosses in Wakefield today. Appalled they’re still pursuing plan to close Pontefract midwife led unit, going against national guidance on choice for mums. Driven by cuts &amp; problems at Pinderfields not Ponte. Why when there’s a problem do they always cut services in towns?

Violent crime recorded by police rises by 19% yet charges are down. Police are increasingly overstretched. Home Office need to show much stronger leadership as well as provide more resources to prevent &amp; tackle violent crime https://t.co/SkyDyYzGzI
Realise some people are in usual shouting match about anything to do with Brexit. But hoping most people will agree it’s OK to call for common sense. If Govt runs out of time, everyone may need bit longer so families, jobs &amp; public services don’t pay price
PM delayed &amp; didn’t put deal to vote until 21 out of 24m of A50 process gone. Govt knows it needs more time but won’t admit it. Blaming MPs for trying to help is like students who are about to fail an exam lashing out at teachers who are trying to get them a bit of extra time
Some people may not be worried about tariffs on food, delays to medicines, clogged up ports and weakened border security - but many are really worried about the impact of No Deal on families who would be hit through no fault of their own
The bill has limited effect - it doesn’t change constitution/stop Brexit/revoke Article 50/determine what happens next. It just gives Govt &amp; Parliament the chance to ask for a bit more time if country is facing No Deal https://t.co/ib4rE6BTTj
Here’s the Bill. It gives the Govt til end of Feb to sort things out, but if they haven’t, then Parliament would get a vote on whether to extend article 50 &amp; get a bit more time. It gives Govt &amp; Parliament a chance to avert No Deal in March if time has run out https://t.co/P2rMfDuEZ3
No responsible Government would ever take this country into a No Deal Brexit - undermining border security &amp; the fight against crime &amp; terrorism. Theresa May knows this so she should support our bill. https://t.co/xY9TbyugIa

Govt shd be ruling out No Deal. People have a right to expect that their govt will prevent the kind of crisis that delays their medicines, pushes up price of food, clogs up motorways &amp; ports, puts manufacturers’ supplies at risk or makes it easier for criminals to evade justice
PM’s plan B today was just plan A again even tho that lost by 230 votes. I am really worried that PM’s drift &amp; delay is pushing country into deeply damaging No Deal by accident. That’s why I’ve put forward this bill https://t.co/7L0oOq3fJu
Love this https://t.co/2AM0a8qwEj
Good article by @stellacreasy &amp; @lisanandy - time to look at citizens assemblies to help widen the #Brexit debate https://t.co/4FGBu8wsHc
PM is behaving as if she lost by 30 votes not 230 - refusing to change any of her red lines even tho those red lines led to the deal that Parliament just defeated. Asked her if she was still  ruling out a customs union in any circumstance. She just repeated her red line
@guyverhofstadt @Europarl_EN Agree it’s crucial that rights of EU citizens living here &amp; UK citizens living across EU must be protected whatever happens. UK &amp; EU Parliaments must together keep up pressure on all Govts &amp; Commission to make sure this happens.
Good question to PM by @SeemaMalhotra1 - shocking that Theresa May doesn’t seem to be capable of admitting that she has to change. Her response to losing by 230 votes is just to think she can invite people in to tell them why she is right and they are wrong. https://t.co/jvfS51qncD
Andrea Leadsom making a mockery of Theresa May’s proposal for cross party talks this morning. Ludicrous &amp; unworkable if PM won’t even talk to @jeremycorbyn &amp; other party leaders. PM has to accept she failed by 230 votes - she can’t just keep digging in
Seriously? Same old red lines from Theresa May? Even though she just lost by 230 votes? She can’t keep behaving like this. Makes a complete mockery of all her words after the vote https://t.co/6xY7ENgael
This was the biggest Government defeat in over 100 yrs. PM says she now will listen &amp; work cross party but she had 30 months to do that and she repeatedly refused. She cannot just carry on as if nothing has changed.
Wrote this 18m ago calling on PM to build consensus &amp; establish cross party approach. She refused. PM was repeatedly urged to consult public &amp; Parliament inc votes on negotiating objectives. She refused. Hollow words on reaching out now https://t.co/ikPpyw8aZT
This mess is of Theresa May’s making. She repeatedly failed to consult Parliament or public on negotiating objectives, repeatedly refused to reach out or build consensus, repeatedly fudged &amp; delayed. Brinkmanship is not the answer. PM is letting country down
Tonight I will vote against Theresa May’s botched deal. This isn’t a deal it’s a stop gap - blind on customs, trade, jobs, policing &amp; security, and weakening us for the future negotiations ahead https://t.co/zTXyyHpM7D
Update from police: suspect now charged &amp; increased neighbourhood team presence in town today. All this reinforces my view that we badly need more Govt investment in policing - inc neighbourhood police &amp; crime prevention which have both been heavily cut back across country

We need guarantees that Parliament will get a vote and that country won’t drift or be forced by Government into No Deal, with deeply damaging consequences for jobs, manufacturing and for our national security - my urgent question in Commons https://t.co/KHnufNs1PU
About to ask Urgent Question of Govt to make sure there is no chance of them using loopholes to avoid a Parliamentary vote - on deal or no deal - by 21 January
This is the #AskTheCommons clarification Speaker was referring to. Appears to defer to courts to decide if Commons can vote on No Deal. But if Govt tried to use this to force No Deal thru without a vote, wd be a constitutional outrage. Gov shd clarify now https://t.co/ehSdjq3zzI
Raised this in Commons with Speaker now - he says it has been corrected/ clarified but he cannot currently provide assurance that under the legislation there will definitely be a vote on the Government’s plan if they decide to switch to No Deal https://t.co/PD0xiOMaug
PM tells Commons the problem is the backstop. But Irish PM says “UK Govt decided to take lots of options off the table.... We ended up with the backstop because of all of the red lines that the UK laid down.” https://t.co/jfGlEkCjOQ
I don’t believe Parliament - or even this PM - will let No Deal happen in the end as the damage to our economy &amp; security are too great. But highly irresponsible &amp; costly for PM to deliberately escalate doubt for several months because she’s failed to build support for her deal https://t.co/pdBbEt0QGh
This is completely irresponsible. We can’t wait for clarity til Jan/Feb. Even if she hasn’t got a final plan, PM must urgently rule out No Deal now. Otherwise every Govt Department &amp; every trading company will have to spend next 2months chucking everything at No Deal preparations https://t.co/iFzU9jskvS
PM making our country look chaotic &amp; ridiculous. 5hrs ago Ministers &amp; No10 were insisting vote was going ahead. Now we don’t know when or even what PM wants it to be on. How can there be trust &amp; credibility in this process if no one can trust anything Ministers are told to say? https://t.co/8TU45QdKB4
Hang on. What happens if the Govt never brings this deal back for a vote at all? They can’t just avoid a vote on no deal because they pulled the vote in the middle of the debate on this deal! As I was typing @JustineGreening just asked q on this but got no clear answer. https://t.co/PD0xiOMaug

Brexit Deal on security explained in less than 60 words: No access to vital SIS2 database. No European Arrest Warrant. No guarantee we get them in new Security Treaty (which they haven’t started negotiating) Police say losing these makes us less safe #Yourenotbeingstraightwithus https://t.co/WOcIPwXdG9
Trouble is this isn’t a deal, it’s a stop gap. There’s no clarity about future. PM wants everyone to blindly trust her to sort it out. But if she won’t even be straight with us about the deal she’s got, then how on earth can she built that trust? #LiaisonCommittee https://t.co/FIzH8RGOh9
PM’s Deal doesn’t include access to crucial SIS2 &amp; ECRIS criminal databases, despite her trying hard. Yet Govt’s security assessment assumes we keep that access. I challenge PM on importance of being straight with people over security downgrade #LiaisonCommittee https://t.co/S28jEwSuyH
Having known Theresa May for 20 years, I don’t believe she would go ahead with No Deal even if (or when) her Deal is rejected. The security &amp; economic risks are too great. Here’s my first question to her at #LiaisonCommittee https://t.co/kMr7fmL9Rz
Govt is not being straight w people about security downgrade in PMs deal. Today’s so called “assessment of security partnership” is a wish list. It assumes PMs deal keeps SIS2 &amp; ECRIS criminal databases even tho PM failed to get them in Political Declaration despite pushing hard
This isn’t a deal it’s a stop gap. Still no idea if future partnership will be Norway/Chequers/Canada/endless backstop/security downgrade/something worse. Yet PM wants us to walk out now with no idea where we’re going, giving EU more leverage &amp; weakening our negotiating hand https://t.co/VhpSu0Bpm1
Nearly an hour in - MPs from all sides speaking, but not a single one in favour of PM’s Deal
The trouble with this “renewal &amp; reconciliation” stuff from the Prime Minister is that she’s done the complete opposite for the last two &amp; a half years. She never consulted on the objectives, never tried to build consensus. How on earth does she expect people to believe her now?
Dominic Raab now saying very clearly that the new trade deal w EU can’t possibly be in place by the end of the transition - yet he still wants to leave the customs union &amp; single market then, leaving Britain’s manufacturers &amp; traders completely in the lurch
When she published the Withdrawal Agreement, the PM effectively admitted to me that the security deal wasn’t yet strong enough. But No 10 said it wd be OK because they would secure access to the crucial SIS2 criminal database in the Political Declaration. They’ve failed. https://t.co/rNmGNaxViF
PM told us “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” - yet now she’s trying to push thru withdrawal terms with nothing agreed on future plan. Today’s Political Declaration isn’t an agreement, it’s a fudge. Doesn’t change my article from last week. https://t.co/RRanhc49if
At heart of this is making sure no one ever accepts a mother &amp; baby unit for asylum seekers with damp, mould &amp; rodent infestation. We need to know that urgent action has been taken in this &amp; other cases &amp; that @ukhomeoffice &amp; @IndependentCI are working together to make it happen
Given different accounts of what @IndependentCI told Home Office we are now seeking urgent further info from Inspectorate inc ensuring they give all important info re substandard housing (&amp; contract failings) to @ukhomeoffice so there is urgent action to improve accommodation
Independent Inspector for Customs, Borders &amp; Immigration has now contacted @CommonsHomeAffs with further information that supports the evidence that Immigration Minister &amp; @ukhomeoffice officials gave to us this afternoon
3. More contradictory information received since the committee session this evening - but this time from the Inspector supporting the information the Immigration Minister &amp; @ukhomeoffice officials gave us
In the course of the session we were given conflicting information between Home Office &amp; independent Inspectorate - yet consequence is that we can’t find out whether mothers &amp; children are still in poor accommodation. Seeking urgent explanation from Inspectorate &amp; Home Office
1. Quite incredible session with Immigration Minister &amp; senior officials at @CommonsHomeAffs on asylum accommodation this pm. Even by @ukhomeoffice standards this was bad. More wrong information. Contradicted within the hour. What is going on? https://t.co/iuNFMs3Ta7

6. But nor should the PM be threatening UK with No Deal just to get a weak deal through. Parliament rightly cannot accept No Deal, that’s why it’s time for Govt, Parliament &amp; EU to stop the ticking clock, extend Article 50, pause for breath &amp; think again.
5. Theresa May hoped that by fudging the long term future deal she could persuade enough people to sign up blindfold and give her &amp; the EU negotiators the benefit of the doubt. But she has failed to build trust with anyone, hence the mess.
4. Even on the economy &amp; trade, we weaken our negotiating power if we walk out now with so little clue where we are heading. How can Parliament sign up to that in the national interest?
3. But there’s no Plan B on security. No one involved thinks a future Security Treaty can be agreed &amp; fully ratified in each member state in 2yrs. But unlike on Northern Ireland or customs, there’s no security backstop to prevent serious capability gap when transition runs out.
2. Cross border crime &amp; threats increasing, yet Deal has no agreement on SIS2 criminal database which U.K. checks 500 million x a transition for wanted criminals, terror suspects, weapons. Nor any commitment to replica EAW. (Full article outside paywall) https://t.co/2wWuDzCfVd
1. A blindfold Brexit deal with so little agreed on future security &amp; economic cooperation is too risky &amp; weakens UK negotiating power on the future partnership. My article from last week on why Parliament shd vote against PMs deal &amp; extend Article 50 https://t.co/nbKWjL0laf
UN highlights appalling impact on women “If you had got group of misogynists [to design welfare policy]... you wouldn’t have come up with something very different from what’s in place.” @David_Cameron &amp; @George_Osborne were warned repeatedly on this. Will they answer this charge?
“Poverty is a political choice” - Deeply damning verdict on Tory Govts austerity policies from UN’s ⁦@Alston_UNSR⁩ - made yet more shameful by the fact that Govt  is cutting family support again next year &amp; pushing more children into poverty https://t.co/aSHKjPKfAi

Policing Minister tells @CommonsHomeAffs there is no chance of getting bilateral extradition deals in place for all of the 19-20 EU countries that won’t extradite their own citizens outside the EU by March 2019 if there is No Deal https://t.co/0so6kV7HIE
So - pretty big gap between this and the Brexit promises
And Permanent Secretary told us today lots of staff will have to be moved out of Immigration Enforcement to work on No Deal instead https://t.co/UD78UMaJE9
Immigration Minister has said there will be no additional checks at the border, no additional employment checks &amp; they won’t be able to distinguish between new arrivals &amp; long standing residents - so free movement continues
Police, Border Force &amp; Permanent Secretary have all said they won’t have access to SIS2 European database of suspects &amp; criminals at the border - so less security at border
Another day at @CommonsHomeAffs trying to get to bottom of Home Office plans for No Deal. Here’s what Home Office have now told us No Deal means: 1. Less security at border. 2. Free movement continues. 3. Less immigration enforcement. Not sure that’s what people voted for.

@montie Tim, DC attacked Europe for yrs, then assumed he cd win referendum to stay in a few months. He had no plan for how to remain. And no plan for how to leave. Which is why we’re all in a mess now. He was PM. Whatever your views on Brexit, you can’t possibly think he was good at this

Home Sec on @itvpeston says in the event of No Deal there will be a “sensible transition period” with same employer checks on EU citizens as now. Which is rather different from what we were told at @CommonsHomeAffs yesterday..... 1/2 https://t.co/0dEtunMwCA
This is great news for Yorkshire https://t.co/2Ei386VL6A
14. Hence the face. https://t.co/ZratZGWbCx
13. And some of this might be cleared up in an Immigration Bill which Govt admits probably won’t be through Parliament before March 2019
12. Some of this might be cleared up by the Immigration White Paper which might or might not be published before any deal is agreed (or not agreed). That’s the Immigration White Paper that was originally supposed to be published fifteen months ago.
11. In a late “clarification” last night Home Office added that employers would only have to check EU citizens passports (not clear how that fits with points above)
10. But in the event of No Deal Govt says employers will still have a responsibility to check. But it’s not clear what or how.
9. And Govt accepts that as a result employers won’t be able to tell the difference between someone who has lived here for years (and is entitled but not yet signed up to settled status) and someone who has arrived after March 2019
8. But Govt also says most existing residents won’t be signed up to the settled status scheme by March 2019. It’s not even properly open yet.
7. In the event of No Deal, Gov says employers will have to check whether an EU citizen is entitled to work
6. Also in the event of No Deal, Govt says newly arriving EU citizens will be treated in the same way as non-EU citizens. As soon as possible.
5. Also in the event of No Deal, Govt says free movement will “be turned off at that point”
4. In the event of No Deal, Gov says EU citizens who are existing residents in UK still retain all their rights to work and newly arriving citizens will be able to work if they have signed up for mandatory registration
3. Also, Govt says EU citizens won’t go in the same border/passport queues as non-EU citizens. Little bit fuzzy on whether they will stay in same queues as UK citizens or have their own queue, but they will use the same e-gates
2. Govt says in the event of No Deal, there will be no change in the checks on EU citizens at the border, and EU citizens will be able to travel into the UK same as now. People won’t need visas.
1. Govt says in the event of No Deal, UK will still respect rights of EU citizens living here now &amp; the same settled status scheme will apply as if there was a deal
So after yesterday’s confusion at @CommonsHomeAffs over Govt No Deal immigration plans here’s a thread on what I think we gleaned (and yes I know it’s full of contradictions &amp; I assume some bits are wrong but afraid I don’t know which bits) https://t.co/r0Yzwi9nFq
Astonishing session at @CommonsHomeAffs this afternoon trying to get to bottom of Govt No Deal preparations. Home Office still doesn’t know what security impact on border will be of losing access to EU criminal databases for border checks THERES ONLY 5 MONTHS https://t.co/li4CkBJWd9
People on £90-100k a yr will get tax cut worth £860 in April, those on £125k will get £600 - far more than low paid workers, at a time when child poverty going up, benefits being cut, vital council services being cut, police badly overstretched. This is wrong. I cannot support it https://t.co/DQEjiLJEA2
Women now shouldering 87% of burden of Tory tax/benefit changes since 2010 - @commonslibrary tells me. #Budget2018 widens gender gap further as puts more into raising tax allowances (which affects more men) than Universal Credit (which affects more women) #SameOldTories https://t.co/Uqd5CJsBoI
Those on low income lose £500 a year, those on higher income gain £500 a year - chart from @resfoundation on impact of Hammond Budget &amp; Spring statement #Budget2018 #SameOldTories https://t.co/4gvM3tHhqx
#Budget2018 includes faster increase in higher rate threshold - so looks like that means hundreds of pounds in tax cuts next yr for people on a hundred thousand pounds a year. When public services still being cut https://t.co/Prx1vFzMns
This is important. Policing urgently needs more funding as @CommonsHomeAffs said last wk. Crime up while arrests down. Yet nothing for mainstream policing today &amp; this chart ominous for spending review. CT money welcome, but never forget neighbourhood policing crucial for CT too https://t.co/w6uqZMWREv

Shocking new Home Office data out today shows arrests almost halved over 10 yrs &amp; down 8% last yr. Also 24% drop in fraud arrests in a year. Confirms our @CommonsHomeAffs report view that police badly overstretched &amp; arrests are falling at same time as crimes are rising https://t.co/k7X83KiCZ0
Home Sec statement on Home Office unlawfully requiring DNA tests is deeply troubling. Coming after #Windrush shows something going v wrong in Home Office again. New wider review must be independent &amp; shd examine oversight failure &amp; impact of policies on culture of HO operations

Response from @policesupers to @CommonsHomeAffs  “I am grateful for the level of detail and enquiry they have undertaken to support their conclusions, which have vindicated what I and my Association have been highlighting for a number of years.” https://t.co/ytUZmuMUfS
Response from @PoliceChiefs ; “Today's report rightly recognises that forces &amp; officers have come under ‘serious strain’ ...The committee warns that without additional funding ...’there will be dire consequences for public safety’ – that warning must surely be heeded.” https://t.co/GRWb9KYvhB
10. Work the police do is crucial for every one of us - keeping us safe, protecting the vulnerable, preventing crimes, pursuing justice, catching criminals, supporting communities -that’s why it’s vital the police get more resources &amp; more Home Office support
9. Above all, we found policing suffering from complete failure of Home Office leadership. Changing public safety threats need partnership w NHS, internet companies, tech upgrades, new ways of working that HO shd lead. HO can’t keep standing back &amp; leaving police to do this alone
8. Investment in &amp; adoption of new technology is an utter mess. Lack of up to date digital capability is now systemic problem. Serious failure of coordination and leadership on upgrading tech. Ludicrous that police still struggling with out of date tech
7. Too often police are the only emergency support available for those in mental health crisis - which is completely inappropriate for patients &amp; is overstretching the police. New NHS funding must support mental health crisis work.
6. Tackling new online crimes cannot be done by the police alone. We call for private sector contribution to funding online law enforcement &amp; new requirements on tech &amp; social media companies to tackle online child sexual abuse. Needs Home Office leadership to pursue
5. Online child abuse is growing yet the number of charges fell last year, there is just one arrest for every ten recorded incidents. @CommonsHomeAffs deeply concerned about failure to protect children &amp; calls for investment, cross-Govt strategy &amp; Commissioner
4. Growing online crimes not being dealt with. @CommonsHomeAffs found tiny proportion of online fraud investigated &amp; just 3% of Action Fraud cases lead to charge. Fundamental overhaul needed so online fraud is investigated regionally &amp; nationally, instead of by local forces
3. New data gathered by @CommonsHomeAffs found neighbourhood policing cut by 20% &amp; some forces have lost over 2/3 of neighbourhood officers. Report concludes that cuts to neighbourhood policing are false economy &amp; forces need to rebuild community capacity
2. Recorded crime is up 32% in 3 years – including steep rises in robbery, theft and vehicle crime - but charges and summons are down 26%. Our report found forces struggling as result of falling staff numbers, outdated tech, fragmentation &amp; lack of Home Office leadership
Policing urgently needs more money in Budget &amp; CSR. Our ⁦⁦@CommonsHomeAffs⁩ report found police officers doing remarkable job in difficult circs, but forces badly overstretched. Report warns of serious consequences if funding not increased  https://t.co/rJHwCLy9cJ
Police across country still performing remarkable public service but in increasingly difficult circumstances - with changing patterns of crime, outdated technology &amp; failure of Home Office leadership to address new demands

Without analysis on relationship between trade &amp; immigration, and on how to address impact on key sectors like social care, Parliament &amp; Govt still doesn’t have the info it needs to inform the negotiations &amp; future plans
MAC also says it’s very worried about impact of policies &amp; recommendations on recruitment to social care but provides no answers to solve problem
MAC report today v puzzling; ignores crucial relationship between immigration &amp; trade and explicitly makes no recommendation on whether immigration shd be part of negotiations.

Thankyou @safepassageuk for fighting so hard for family reunion. HO must now reconsider cases wherever possible. We need to know how default setting of the Home Office has become so hostile to child refugees that it failed them badly even when Ministers had announced they wd help
Previously Home Office suggested it was the French “sparse” &amp; rushed process that prevented 530 children &amp; teens being given proper reasons - now it turns out French officials called for more info, but it was Home Office lawyers who advised against. Shameful, shameful, shameful
Everyone knows the Home Office gets decisions wrong. Think on Windrush, or the high levels of successful immigration appeals. But these kids - some of the most vulnerable of all - weren’t even given the chance to challenge basic errors or wrong decisions
When the camp was cleared, they were told to use legal routes to join family in UK, but when they were turned down &amp; given no reason &amp; no hope, many just disappeared again - probably back into the arms of smugglers, traffickers or abusers
Remember these were very vulnerable children &amp; teenagers who had often been alone in Calais many months - often subjected to abuse, exploitation, sexual violence
Truly, truly shocking. Home Office lawyers appear to have deliberately advised against giving child &amp; teen refugees in France the reasons why they were refused family reunion with relatives in UK to prevent them appealing against decision. Level of inhumanity in this is appalling https://t.co/wAiO3ZtZWk
Really important court judgement today about Home Office failure to help lone child refugees reunite with family in UK - huge tribute to work of @safepassageuk https://t.co/wAiO3ZtZWk

The Government was warned about this. Again. And again.

Why the shenanigans? Why not just admit what they are doing? Presumably because they are still pandering to ERG rhetoric. But problem is - as I said to PM last week - they just aren’t straight with people so everyone is confused &amp; no one trusts what the Govt is doing ...7/7 https://t.co/2hUg87nlzh

UK Govt has rightly long believed those who commit barbaric crimes shd be locked away for rest of lives. In previous cases UK sought assurances against death penalty at same time as strongly pursuing justice, punishment &amp; public protection. No answer on why they’ve changed now
Security Minister’s attempt to justify Home Sec decision not to even ask US for assurances against death penalty is unravelling. He now seems to be saying that whilst we don’t have death penalty in UK, we do respect it elsewhere. That’s a major, unilateral shift in foreign policy
UK govt; “it is the long standing policy of the UK to oppose the death penalty in ALL circumstances AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE.” How can it be a principle if Home Sec has just ripped it up in practice? How can it be all circumstances if it’s not applied in these circumstances?

And here’s the amendment the Govt is about to try &amp; accept from the ERG group. Requires reciprocal arrangements on customs duty collection - as a way to scupper the whole deal. Completely opposite of white paper! https://t.co/gU1sy16SwI
Govt ripping a hole in its own white paper within 4 days. Here’s what Govt said on Thursday - explicitly not asking EU for reciprocal arrangements on tariff collection cos they know EU won’t agree and it would put their customs plan at risk https://t.co/OBUXnN8PZW
ERG trying to rule out any kind of customs deal in Brexit at all - their approach would hit Yorkshire manufacturing hard with extra border delays, customs bureaucracy &amp; costs. Spoke in Commons debate today to support Yorkshire manufacturing &amp; customs union deal
Trump’s appalling behaviour makes me sympathise with Theresa May. Til I remember her desperate rush to invite him, her repeated reluctance to criticise his Muslim ban or caging of children, her chasing him for a bad trade deal.... For God’s sake Theresa, stand up to him today.

Far too many of our questions about the shocking way people were treated remain unanswered. We still need to know how many of Windrush generation were illegally detained, or lost their jobs, homes or NHS treatment as a result of appalling Home Office decisions @CommonsHomeAffs

First #Eurovision2018 vote of evening; are we using @bbceurovision or @Eurovision scorecard? Beeb has photos which is good at end when you’ve forgotten who was who. But it requires separate scores for song, performance &amp; staging which is fine at first but will be boring by Norway https://t.co/hZSNRj4avZ
Belhaj case immensely serious &amp; troubling. Makes the 2 forthcoming ISC reports on detainees &amp; rendition (sent to PM today) even more important. Gibson Inquiry before it closed early listed 27 unanswered issues. Govt &amp; agencies must be vigilant always in protecting human rights
Both camps are just digging us all into a hole. Both their customs plans hit manufacturing hard. Neither side is being honest about costs. Both "Max Fac" &amp; "Customs Partnership" mean UK manufacturers face burdensome "rules of origin" checks. Manufacturing needs customs union deal https://t.co/DdkL8zzxhD

We put this to Immigration Minister at @CommonsHomeAffs today - shocked that neither Ministers nor senior officials had even asked for a review of this problem especially when I raised it in Commons debate last week. Suggested they do so this evening. Immigration Minister agreed https://t.co/2s6MVBUmiQ
More troubling confusion from the Home Office at @CommonsHomeAffs today..... https://t.co/0nUAMStgZa
Today @CommonsHomeAffs will take evidence from Immigration Minister @carolinenokes , Home Office Perm Sec &amp; DG of Immigration Enforcement. Part of our inquiry into immigration detention. Will also include qs on #Windrush. HMIP from 2.30pm then Minister &amp; officials after 3.30pm
Raised this with Home Office Ministers in Parliament in debate on Wednesday. Asked Ministers to respond. No answers yet. https://t.co/SiYaL6i1xL

Raised this in Commons debate on Windrush today - asked immigration minister to look into it &amp; real concerns about others affected by same culture of disbelief https://t.co/d5ABNFRecj
Both @CatherineWest1 &amp; I have just raised this directly with Immigration Minister in Parliament &amp; asked for urgent clarification. In a system with no independent appeals or checks to stop unfair removals, it would be extremely troubling if bonuses were paid for removal targets. https://t.co/loSzUi05VE
Also, as we warned at @CommonsHomeAffs there are other Home Office injustices that must be urgently addressed - given evidence we have seen on immigration detention
Urgent tasks for new Home Sec; bring in support/compensation framework for Windrush families, end net migration target which has incentive for HO to get ppl to leave whether legal or illegal, &amp; look at urgently restoring appeals &amp; legal aid which cd have helped prevent injustices
Continual changing and inaccuracy makes things worse not better https://t.co/U4P7OnCs1A
.@BrandonLewis please withdraw your claim on @MarrShow this morning #Marr that @CommonsHomeAffs was only asking @AmberRuddHR about KPIs or local targets. It doesn’t help anyone and is completely inappropriate for you to try to rewrite committee questions https://t.co/HlUwsL7wmm
Well this is clearly not true. https://t.co/4RTgj5K0sz

Truly cannot believe this! No wonder we spent yesterday’s customs union debate worrying that Ministers were completely out of touch with the reality at our border ports. They haven’t even tried. https://t.co/42UPMrSvNG
Serious &amp; thoughtful debate on customs union in Parliament all afternoon today - powerful evidence put on all sides in support of a customs union deal for sake of manufacturing and Northern Ireland border. Government would be very foolish to ignore the strength of this debate
Now Home Office is revisiting targets will they end PM’s net migration target that underpins everything? It undermines confidence in Home Office decisions when they have  incentive to get people to leave, no matter if legally or illegally here or how long resident, to meet target https://t.co/ReQ97QPbRc
This is a complete fudge answer to my question on whether the Home Office has targets for immigration removals after the contradictory evidence from the ISU &amp; the Home Secretary at @CommonsHomeAffs today.

For sake of manufacturing industry &amp; Northern Ireland border, 12 cross party committee chairs have proposed this motion for a customs union in Brexit deal. Debate &amp; vote on Thursday. Government should listen before it is too late https://t.co/jz58brrIZE
Real concerns that there is a culture of disbelief &amp; requirements for impossible levels of proof in Home Office which is being driven by pressure to meet the net migration target. Asked Home Sec to end the net migration target as @CommonsHomeAffs recommended in our report
Select committee has warned Govt repeatedly about errors &amp; failings in decisions, people here legally being wrongly pursued, operation of “hostile environment” &amp; half of appeals being upheld as HO getting things wrong, not just on Windrush cases. Govt still not addressing that
Govt shd provide compensation &amp; pay citizenship fees for Windrush generation. But must do more. I heard today from pensioner from Kenya turned away by new helpline because not Windrush. Others who came here yrs ago as children on parents passports &amp; being wrongly pursued by HO
Congratulations Jon - great run &amp; great cause https://t.co/8aZX4VksH7

Govt response to @CommonsHomeAffs January immigration report was published today. It shows no new action &amp; shocking complacency over the “deeply damaging &amp; traumatic” errors that we warned them about (see 2 of our recommendations &amp; their responses below) https://t.co/y9KfZKHNjE
Home Office apparently reviewing 49 Windrush cases that have been raised with them. In last 3 yrs several hundred people over 40 have been deported to Caribbean Commonwealth countries. Will the Home Office review each one in case any are #Windrush children? https://t.co/FiTRN1JQi6
At @CommonsHomeAffs today we agreed to call Home Secretary @AmberRuddHR to give evidence to us next week on #Windrush
Home Office says it is reviewing 49 #Windrush cases. Not doing enough. They shouldn’t be waiting for #Windrush families to call them. Home Office should itself review every #Windrush generation case it is pursuing. Here’s some of @CommonsHomeAffs many questions to the Home Office https://t.co/Nt4yt6jKym
Here’s @CommonsHomeAffs warning to Government about serious errors &amp; weaknesses in the “hostile environment” policy from one of our reports earlier this year https://t.co/aNjhdVwhLC
“There have always been racists &amp; anti-semites lurking at the margins ....but what’s so heartbreaking is concerted efforts to downplay the problem” -powerful, moving speech from @RuthSmeeth .So grateful to Ruth for incredible fight &amp; leadership against antisemitism. Please watch https://t.co/1aAymE7iYn

How many people deported? How many detained? How many have had driving licences seized? How many cases are being reviewed? What is being done to stop people losing healthcare?....... 23 questions to Home Sec from @CommonsHomeAffs on #Windrush children https://t.co/TKg3AXQjPc
Windrush children rightfully living &amp; working here over 50 yrs, are losing jobs, homes, healthcare, are being locked up &amp; even deported all as a result of appalling, shameful &amp; wrong Home Office decisions. My Q to Home Sec earlier today demanding urgent action https://t.co/ZuRNwt0wz9
Shifting answers from Ministers on whether they saw officials analysis that police cuts “likely contributed” to rise in crime. Raises real Qs about how Home Office uses evidence. If they saw it why not address it in strategy. If they didn’t, they shd be asking why on earth not https://t.co/r7Z98kSMqi
New strategy badly needed given tragic deaths &amp; rising violent crime, but whilst scope is welcome (prevention, early intervention, legislation), scale of new interventions are limited (small pilots, more coordination) &amp; HO can’t keep ducking Q on lack of neighbourhood policing https://t.co/ByZdSjsCG4
Powerful article by @DavidLammy here - Govt response is not yet enough https://t.co/unLKGZ4KJL
This is shocking. Surely Home Office officials sent the document to Home Sec, to junior ministers and to special advisors? Cant imagine a department withholding from decision makers the evidence &amp; analysis it did for a new strategy. Something has gone very wrong in Home Office https://t.co/E481KFN5lj
Astonished by Home Sec claims there are enough police. @CommonsHomeAffs has heard repeated evidence on how overstretched police are. Also neighbourhood policing has been cut &amp; youth services slashed. Govt is right to act on violent crime but must include investment in prevention
No one shd have to put up with this. @lucianaberger stood firm against vile antisemitic threats from far right. So shameful that she now faces antisemitic abuse from some who think they’re on left. @UKLabour must be better than this. Pls read her article  https://t.co/hph7UhoxUu
The referendum was nearly two years ago, yet the Government still hasn’t sorted out so many of the fundamental issues. The PM keeps kicking the can down the road. But with just twelve months to go that road is running out. #1yrArticle50 ....ENDS https://t.co/k7pY3Wq21h
That’s just Home Affairs. On future trade plans, customs plans, environment plans, medicine plans and other important programmes and agencies, we still don’t know where we stand. And the legislation keeps being delayed
And, of course, the Govt needs to recruit and train the 1,300 extra border staff and 1,200 immigration staff they’ve now promised
The registration system for EU nationals is delayed &amp; wont go live until the end of this year. That gives the Govt two years to process 3.5m EU citizens, as well as those who arrive during the transition. That means the Home Office granting one application every 3.75 seconds.
The Security Treaty will take time to negotiate (it’s taken Norway over 10 yrs to get an extradition deal), time to get a data adequacy agreement and time for all member states to ratify (that bit alone takes 18 months). And it could all be delayed by referral to the ECJ.
Meanwhile they are still way off track for getting the Security Treaty (on European Arrest Warrant, Europol, criminal data sharing etc) ratified and implemented by December 2020 - https://t.co/YJYQFLbXGd
On Dover and other ports, the technology &amp; camera solutions that could prevent delays outside the customs union are still years away
The cross-party Northern Ireland Committee, inc both Leave &amp; Remain voters couldnt find any technology solution to prevent a hard border https://t.co/OJkN55froL
Then there’s borders. Particularly in Ireland, but they’ve not worked out how to solve the problems at other borders if we are outside a customs union too
If the PM eventually decides she won’t discuss immigration with the EU, then we are left with a Canada deal. If she eventually concedes that she will put it on the table, she’s running out of time to sort it out.
And where’s the time left for public consultation or Parliamentary debate - even though there are strong differences of opinion and we need enough time to get it right?
Nor is there time to properly work one out. The Migration Advisory Committee doesn’t report until the autumn. We won’t see the Immigration White Paper until the end of the year at the earliest.
So 6 months to the end of negotiations. 12 months to the end of EU membership. Immigration was the biggest referendum issue nearly 2 years ago. Yet the Cabinet hasn’t got a position. And the Home Secretary hasn’t got a position.
The Home Secretary doesn’t even have any draft proposals or recommendations ready - all she has is some vague options then says it’s up to the Brexit Secretary &amp; PM to decide https://t.co/lFj5SRMNck
But the British Government hasn’t even worked out whether to talk about it - never mind what to say
The European Council guidelines show they do expect immigration arrangements to be included in the discussions on the Future Partnership https://t.co/TUAOOYmFkF
With only 6 months to complete the negotiations and bring a deal to Parliament, the UK Government hasn’t even decided if it wants immigration to be discussed
1 year to go to Brexit. Is the Government ready? Not if this evidence is anything to go by. #1yrArticle50 ......THREAD https://t.co/EoEssyeUEQ

Btw this is the same illegal National Action video that @CommonsHomeAffs has raised with @YouTube EIGHT times as we keep finding it online. Surely their precious algorithms shd be able to tell the poor reviewers that it’s the same ILLEGAL video they’ve already taken down before

More worrying evidence that Govt hostility to customs union is threatening crucial UK manufacturing industry https://t.co/ZPX5kDcxY0
Expecting new answers today from PM on how she will avoid hard Irish border or deliver frictionless trade outside a customs union? Here's what she said. https://t.co/9hJKUBhmxi
Manufacturers &amp; traders will still end up having to show where components/ingredients come from when trading with EU, comply with "rules of origin", &amp; still need customs checks on  compliance. So no customs union still means friction &amp; UK manufacturing hit #nothinghaschanged 4/4
Put aside fact that many people already described this as unworkable when Govt first proposed it, what happens in modern supply chains when those widgets are then used to build gadgets which are then exported to build wotsits which are then sold back to UK? ....3/4
PM wants zero tariffs between UK &amp; EU, then if we cut tariffs on those Chinese/US widgets then wants HMRC &amp; Border Force to collect UK tariffs on widgets designed for UK markets &amp; EU tariffs on widgets that will be sent on to France or Ireland ....2/2
No workable solution in PM speech for manufacturing outside a customs union either #nothinghaschanged..... 1/4
How can Ireland, EU or UK sign up to something that creates incentive to smuggle or divert trade in this way? No solution to problem that being outside customs union means you need some kind of customs checks or people can legally avoid /illegally evade #nothinghaschanged ...4/4
So let's suppose UK cuts tariffs on Chinese &amp; US widgets. Why would people not just import lots of widgets, then send them across the Irish border through lots of small companies/ small vans then sell them on in the EU for a profit having evaded EU tarrif? .....3/4
PM said 80% of business across NI border is small businesses and they will be treated same as now (presume that means no customs checks, forms or rules of origins requirements????)...... 2/4
Did I misunderstand what PM said on Northern Ireland border? Doesn't sound like any solution at all to problem of hard border outside a customs #nothinghaschanged .......1/4
My God, the damage these two men have done and not a flicker of self doubt. https://t.co/hwesRJXoxT
In NI however last yr there were 4 attacks on police officers lives, 58 shooting &amp; 33 bombing incidents. @PoliceServiceNI warns that at border  "any infrastructure will be some form of threat." Govt has rightly ruled out new physical infrastructure at border. Cameras are physical
Congestion zone also has 197 camera sights which no one notices cos they are in built up areas, no one cares &amp; last time I looked there was a long history of peace between inner and outer London .....2/3
Boris Johnson again today claims congestion charge technology is the answer to Irish border checks if there is no customs union. But congestion charge only has to check which vehicles not what's in them ....1/3 https://t.co/upuUaKfEgY
Vital &amp; brave campaign by @NazShahBfd for Samia Shahid -  fighting against "shame-based" murder &amp; violence against women https://t.co/PhbLM5NFvn
Asked Home Office Ministers to confirm that commitment to "no physical infrastructure" at Irish border includes no cameras to do customs checks as cd become security target. Very concerned that they refused to do so. Avoiding hard border is strong reason to be in customs union

Govt rejection of any customs union deal is very damaging to North &amp; Midlands manufacturing areas. Means extra costs &amp; bureaucracy for industries we shd support.

This is no accident. Govt was warned repeatedly this would happen. Shocking failure to act, shameful social care cuts, irresponsible Tory failure to give our NHS the investment it needs https://t.co/v7LAZi8S6m
Looks like manufacturing areas hardest hit on every option - presumably because all options assume UK will be outside customs union. Irresponsible of Govt not to do analysis of impact of leaving customs union. That's why @RachelReevesMP &amp; I have proposed NC6 to Customs Bill https://t.co/Yxg1O9IBKq
100 years on - the women who fought for the vote still remembered as we use those votes to keep campaigning for women's equality today. This afternoon @CommonsHomeAffs will be taking evidence from @fawcettsociety on tackling misogyny &amp; hate crime #Vote100 #Suffragette100
Yesterday the Immigration Minister told Parliament the White Paper would be published "in the coming months" - today the Home Secretary says it's "likely" that it will be published before March next year. They don't even pretend to be competent any more. This Government is a joke https://t.co/FQbfq2hGqG
This is a complete shambles. They promised it by the end of last year. Govt can't agree what policy should be, so they won't debate it with Parliament. Same pattern each time. Customs union, NI border, immigration.... they can't just keep kicking the can down the road https://t.co/aobHh8bzcm
After great all women @BBCr4today broadcast from Westminster, we're in the suffragette cupboard where Emily Davison hid on the night of the 1911 census @MishalHusainBBC @Sarah_Montague @MaryCreaghMP #Vote100 #Suffragette100 https://t.co/cCnY7RnU2r

About to ask Urgent Question of Home Office - what on earth is going on with Immigration White Paper? https://t.co/iaeMXST473
Agree with Hilary. For sake of Northern &amp; Midlands manufacturing as well as because of Northern Ireland border - we need customs union deal https://t.co/JzntZu3xKF
This is appalling. No excuse for violence &amp; aggression like this https://t.co/cqZIw5ewzw
White Paper was supposed to be published last autumn. Ministers told @CommonsHomeAffs it would be published before Xmas. Then we heard Jan. Then mid Feb. So this is ridiculous. Still waiting for important info on Govt's registration &amp; immigration intentions for March 2019 https://t.co/HIkrXjVC8s
Customs union deal is really important for Yorkshire manufacturers. I hope this @FT story is right - up til now Govt has refused to even do an impact assessment on customs union https://t.co/Wf0qqYodCI
Strong speeches in Parliament today from @HarrietHarman @lucianaberger @EmmaReynoldsMP @TulipSiddiq @MariaMillerUK @gavinshuker about why the House of Commons needs to catch up with the real world on baby leave
Continued police &amp; security cooperation in Brexit deal is vital &amp; has support from all sides. But too many people are assuming it's easy to sort out &amp; is already a done deal. See this warning from British head of Europol about loss of UK influence https://t.co/FOJCUtcXwW
Children of the Kindertransport call for urgent help for child refugees today. Over 200 places offered by local councils for the Dubs scheme a year ago have still not been filled. @AlfDubs is right - Home Office needs to act. #Dubsnow https://t.co/KQn1BNjPGH
North &amp; Midlands hardest hit in this analysis - presumably because all scenarios assume no customs union. Govt is letting northern manufacturers down by failing to analyse customs union options or give Parliament an informed customs union vote https://t.co/ylRBB5ElSJ
#HMD18 reminds us to be vigilant always against prejudice, antisemitism, oppression &amp; hatred. Thankyou @HolocaustUK for bringing new generations the power of words &amp; the voices of those who endured the darkest of times.

Don't think "writing to the Arista agency, reminding them of their legal duty" is enough @EHRC - Arista shd be properly investigated &amp; equality laws shd be enforced. https://t.co/hmdtnHaben

Read this interview. Not just harassment &amp; groping - this is exploiting &amp; pimping young women for rich men and using charity to hide behind. Whole thing must be investigated for breach of law https://t.co/8uX3uXRdn7
Employers shdnt be able to encourage/ ignore harassment of  staff. In 2013 Tories repealed Section 40 of Equality Act &amp; weakened legal protection against harassment at work. Time to put it back! #PresidentsClub #BringBacSec40 https://t.co/oBaNVaFAtp
The Presidents Club &amp; other organisers can't use disclaimers &amp; contract clauses to escape responsibility for this disgraceful event. They should be investigated for breach of law &amp; charity rules. https://t.co/JjQMBu6g3r
Presidents Club can't pretend this is just about a few individuals. @FT shows organisers chose to make dinner men only, to require women staff to parade, drink, wear black skimpy outfits &amp; underwear. Whole thing stinks. They shd be investigated for breach of law &amp; charity rules
The Presidents Club Charity Dinner - a front for groping, harassment &amp; appalling sexism by rich men. Is this what these men demand in order to donate to charitable causes? Utterly appalling &amp; shameful https://t.co/8xibTq99da

Congratulations!! Pioneering. But also just lovely news for the family https://t.co/HC3VwFXoch
Both UK &amp; French Govts were warned the problems in Calais would start again - and they did. Awful conditions, easy prey for smuggler and trafficker gangs, risks to border security
Too little work done at borders across Europe to prevent unaccompanied children being smuggled or trafficked. Too little support for Greece &amp; Italy to deal with asylum claims quickly there...6
children and teenage refugees with family in UK stuck in limbo again as bureaucracy takes ages...5
over 200 places for child &amp; teenage refugees offered by local councils in UK under Dubs scheme have never been filled ..4
But after just a few months that work stopped. Fast track family reunion stopped. Centres for children &amp; teens elsewhere in France closed. Dubs scheme was frozen. And work with Italy &amp; France didn't even start.
18m ago UK &amp; France worked together to get child refugees out of dangerous Calais conditions. France set up centres for them elsewhere, UK fast tracked family reunion &amp; set up Dubs scheme &amp; promised to work w Italy &amp; Greece to prevent people ending up in Calais in first place ..2
UK France cooperation on border security &amp; speeding up help for child refugees is important. But can't just be short term sticking plaster like last time. (Thread)
Outrageous that Carillion bosses who were responsible still get paid while workers lose their jobs &amp; livelihoods, &amp; small businesses lose all the money they are owed https://t.co/GBhf21sx33
All this was predictable. Appalling consequence of Govt decisions; underfunded NHS creates huge pressure &amp; stress, pay squeeze, bursary cuts, handling of EU citizens rights.... So many needed nurses have left their jobs. How can Hunt still be in his? https://t.co/2gqs3P3Dya
A yr ago @CommonsHomeAffs launched National Conversation on immigration w @britishfuture w citizens panels across UK. Today they publish results alongside our report. Shows instead of polarisation there is much common ground. Gov shd promote consensus not allow division to grow https://t.co/In8LxRHom9
We recommend Annual Migration Report (like Budget report) based on public consultation &amp; evidence, to include plans to tackle skills shortages, promote integration, support communities, improve enforcement, as well as immigration targets &amp; controls  https://t.co/m6rsRNwiXM
Reform &amp; public involvement needed to build trust &amp; consensus instead of polarisation over immigration. Our @CommonsHomeAffs report out today https://t.co/m6rsRNwiXM
Other victims outside London also extremely troubled and haven't been told or consulted on licence conditions https://t.co/DY3SzlhlrV
I hope this is right. Deep, deep concerns about this case - even more so after hearing from victims &amp; lawyers. Not enough for Govt to just change Parole Board transparency rules for future cases. Need legal review of this case https://t.co/Nt9kdfLcmZ
Ministers shd stop defending a man who thinks its OK to leer publicly at women's bodies as they work. Govt should have the guts to stand with women across the globe telling men like Toby Young that their #timeisup https://t.co/X0zDG1tiWw

In Mid Yorks Trust patients had to sleep on floor as cdn't get trolley never mind a bed. Here's the incredible response from Health Minister when @TracyBrabin called for Govt apology https://t.co/pAUjPMHIWm
Jon is right - a real apology would be backed up by real action #Marr #NHS https://t.co/Ouq3yKdJBv
"Nothing is perfect. Nothing is perfect." FFS. Who is asking for perfection, PM? We just want our NHS saved from crisis your Govt caused; enough doctors, nurses &amp; investment so patients don't sleep on hospital floor, have all winter ops cancelled or die waiting for emergency care https://t.co/GUpvW2Xtbm
Just watched "apology" on news. Not good enough. PM you were warned repeatedly this wd happen. This is direct result of your policies, your budget decisions, your failure to act. Stuff the apology, get the NHS the investment &amp; support it needs instead https://t.co/f2nuWxv91w

When is a vote meaningful? PM is trying to wriggle out of Amdmnt 7 to deny Parliament the statutory vote we agreed to last week. Here's my Qs at Liason Cttee https://t.co/hNFri23tFW
Read Baker response carefully. Govt is trying to avoid a statutory vote before ratification. His "amendable legislation" comes AFTER not before withdrawal treaty is ratified. That's still trying to unravel amdmt 7 https://t.co/6SJwFfew4c

Questioned @facebook on islamophobic post &amp; adult page encouraging posting of school girl pictures - even tho we challenged them on similar issues in Feb...4
Raised w @YouTube an illegal National Action propaganda video that I had to report 4x including to top executives to get it removed. Yet copyright breaches removed immediately...3
@CommonsHomeAffs @Twitter @facebook @YouTube Found antisemitic, violent &amp; racist tweets that were reported to @Twitter months ago &amp; that they admit break all their standards but are still up...2
Long @CommonsHomeAffs session today with @Twitter @facebook &amp; @YouTube - still not doing enough on extremism &amp; hate crime. Increase in staff &amp; action since we last saw them in  Feb is good but still too many serious examples where they haven't acted ....1
Urged both PM &amp; Home Sec to challenge Daily Mail inflammatory headlines given that the MPs they targeted have received death threats. Its easy to challenge your opponents when they abuse, but more important to challenge your friends
So @Twitter finally suspend Britain First - the day before social media cos appear at @CommonsHomeAffs .Why does it take a Parliamentary hearing to make them do the right thing? https://t.co/WcpCJ1IMlE

. @LizMcInnes_MP asks Home Sec key Q - has anyone in Govt asked Trump to take tweets down. Home Sec doesn't know
Agreed. But have you told the White House this? Have you asked @POTUS to remove those tweets? Do you accept that we cannot give him a state visit to promote Britain First &amp; its hateful views? https://t.co/hvNEjvMOXr
So what has Gov't done? Has No 10 raised it w White House? Has Foreign Sec spoken to US Ambassador. Have they called on @POTUS to remove tweets, told him this woman has been charged w hate crimes in UK, or told him the damage he is doing? https://t.co/LQWIzgr9Fc
UK Gov can't stay silent on Trump tweets. He is promoting woman convicted of hate crime from racist group here in UK. Disgraceful &amp; dangerous https://t.co/DnW4uLUxiF
Govt political handling of Brexit ££ is even more rubbish than normal. If they won't explain at least what kinds of things they think UK shd pay for, how will they persuade public to support any final figure? Esp when we all remember the promise on the bus
Cdnt have imagined there was anything left Trump could do to shock me. But promoting views of woman convicted of hate crime from far right hate group is appalling. UK Gov't must condemn https://t.co/1Er5cqsjFN
But biggest hit still comes from Tories' persisting with big cuts to tax credits, then to Universal Credit. Made worse by public sector pay squeeze
Main measures in 2017 Autumn Budget just mitigation to previous policies (UC, NICs etc). HB changes help women more. NICs changes help men more. But overall women helped by less
So of the £94bn extra raised by Tories in direct tax &amp; benefit changes since 2010 a shocking £81bn has come from women even tho women earn less &amp; own less than men
Gov't still refusing to do gender audit of Budget. Not hard to work out why. So I asked @commonslibrary to do one. Shows 86% of burden since 2010 fallen on women. Shameful https://t.co/VxO1Oe1JpA

What a mess. Analysis here from @OBR_UK - weak economy, Govt spending cuts, Brexit uncertainty hitting growth. UK poorer thanks to Tory Gov't https://t.co/OhxdGaI4LL
Hard to underestimate seriousness of today's downgrade of growth for UK. Devastating verdict on Osborne austerity strategy &amp; Tories' failure to strengthen economy for 7yrs
Not so much extra in #Budget for infrastructure in next couple of yrs, despite downgrade of business investment &amp; productivity making infrastructure even more important https://t.co/PebjG7ziPO
Big downgrade in forecast business investment over next 4yrs, as well as in productivity - makes it even harder to turn productivity around #Budget

.@CommonsHomeAffs very concerned that no one is in charge of Brexit border planning (no lead department or minister). Recipe for confusion &amp; risk of chaos
4% increase in border force staff not enough. Risk that increased Brexit customs pressure will divert staff from security &amp; immigration checks
Contingency planning for "no deal" must accelerate given lead times for staff/systems. Get this wrong &amp; its Operation Stack on steroids @CommonsHomeAffs
Transition agreement vital to avoid serious border queues &amp; reducing of security checks - shd keep same customs arrangements @CommonsHomeAffs https://t.co/ZIf0Q160vQ

Just asked PM to confirm that means if no final trade deal by next Oct that means no transition &amp; WTO tariffs by March19. She ducked Q ..2/3
PM says won't agree transition arrangements til final trade deal is done. Yet at best that is next Oct. How on earth can business plan? 1/3

Authoritative response from @Keir_Starmer on @BBCr4today based on long experience on why problems are about resources not human rights act
A thread here on how TMay always resorts to the same human rights rhetoric when she needs to distract from reality of her security record https://t.co/BtKFax2e14
Serious Qs for Border Force (run directly by Home Office since 2012) on Manchester &amp;London attacks. Were these men stopped at border or not?
June 2017 under pressure on security and police cuts TMay once again says she will ditch human rights #hearditallbefore #weakandwobbly
May 2017 Conservative Manifesto (written by TMay) says UK will not pull out of the ECHR and rules out replacing Human Rights Act
July 2016 said we should defeat modern slavery as it was the greatest human rights issue of our time
June 2016 said she wouldn't pull out of the ECHR as part of her leadership bid (in order to persuade Dominic Grieve to back her)
April 2016 said Britain should pull out of the ECHR but not the EU
October 2013 threatened to pull out of the Human Rights Act on Marr show
October 2012 blocked deportation of Gary Mackinnon because it was "incompatible with his human rights" - &amp; drew on Human Rights Act to do it
October 2011 said Human Rights Act should go because of a cat story which wasn't right
Hmm. Remember cat-gate? Whenever TMay in trouble she whips out the old anti human rights rhetoric. Then says opposite  later #weakandwobbly https://t.co/7e7XlERWPw
TMay cut armed police by 18%. On policing &amp; security she should be judged not by her rhetoric but by her record https://t.co/2jIkCqa3F2

T May promises "security in old age" - but if you get dementia it will cost you your house
T May promises to "overcome enduring social divisions." By bringing back grammars &amp; secondary moderns? seriously?
T May promises to "keep our economy strong" - so why does Bank of England say real wages will fall this year?
T May promises to "govern in interests of ordinary working families" - so why are 3 million of them losing £2500 a year under her plans?

Completely irresponsible to threaten, gamble or bargain on national security. This isn't a threat to EU, it's a dangerous act of self harm https://t.co/bGU1S11Qfx

Report here on our @CommonsHomeAffs anger at Google for doing no checks of YouTube for terrorism or child abuse https://t.co/tQWrqi6yLs
Social media is great thing, but companies who make ££ from it have responsibility to stop pple using it for hatred &amp; ruining others' lives
YouTube also said they do no proactive work to tackle illegal posts - not even on terrorism or online child abuse. Was shocked by that.
None of the companies would tell us how many people they have working on dealing with online abuse or hate crime. Not good enough
Facebook admitted their system for dealing with complaints about sexualised images of children hadn't been effective enough
Too many examples of Twitter taking too long to deal with clear examples of hate crime or abuse including death threats - not good enough
Appalled by YouTube failure to enforce its own community standards by claiming exKKK leader's anti-Semitic video rant isn't hate speech
Today @CommonsHomeAffs questioned Twitter, Facebook &amp; YouTube on hate crime. Multi billion pound cos not doing enough to tackle online abuse

The Dubs scheme is working to help lone child refugees. Today I challenged HomeSec on shameful decision to close it https://t.co/apfOpY0bHl
US President trying to close refugee programmes altogether. Now UK Gov closing Dubs programme for most vulnerable refugees of all. Shameful
Gov't completely wrong to close down Dubs scheme to help lone child refugees after less than 12 months! Refugee crisis hasn't gone away. https://t.co/L16oPJGxS3
Good for Spkr Bercow. Trump is undermining democratic values (rule of law, free press, promoting racism &amp; misogyny) Parlmt shd take a stand https://t.co/sfTaOMtjso

Gov't shouldn't be ruling out customs union; if outside common external tariff then very hard to avoid border checks on goods - friction https://t.co/0X3dmiypyf
In Bedford today for @commonshomeaffs public meeting - part of national debate on immigration. See more details here https://t.co/nVqGrIAq9e
Really disturbing that @Number10gov is still wriggling so desperately to let Trump off the hook over this awful ban ....2/2 https://t.co/ms62TS2Hor
. @AmberRudd_MP was replying to my direct Q about Trump ban &amp; ISIL, she was clearly not talking about "any policy from any Govt.".....1/2 https://t.co/ms62TS2Hor
At @CommonsHomeAffs Home Sec recognised Trump ban is "propaganda opportunity" for ISIL, but hasn't raised that w USGov. I urged her to do so https://t.co/47yKA2CJvU
The motion passed unanimously in House of Commons this eve condemning "Trump's discriminatory, divisive &amp; counterproductive ban" https://t.co/jaZ18KtJhS
My Q to Foreign Sec: Have you urged US to lift this order signed on HMD. For the sake of history, have the guts to speak out https://t.co/EG2Ey1Tpc4
@SamCoatesTimes Astonishing! Blaming the Cttee that makes recommendations not the head of Gov't that chooses to act on them. Not leadership
Seriously? TMay team's modus operandi was often to duck responsibility &amp; blame others but can't do that as PM. This is a joke, surely.... https://t.co/5Vbcq50yhT
I'm supporting this call for emergency debate on Trump ban on refugees &amp; Muslims. What US is doing is v dangerous &amp; we need to speak out https://t.co/EjcvKxFwJD

Theresa May has a responsibility to speak out on behalf of Britain. Her failure to do so shames &amp; embarrasses our country https://t.co/AUXCiPge0d
French &amp; German Govts have condemned Trump ban on refugees &amp; targeting of Muslims. Here's my letter to PM urging UK Gov't to do same https://t.co/EGxsjtAtKL
Trump has banned the USA from giving sanctuary to refugees from genocide or persecution. On Holocaust Memorial Day. https://t.co/H7HnTWYi8e
Nothing shd shock me anymore but am so disturbed that @Number10gov thinks it's OK to brief TMay "praising" Trump just as he endorses torture https://t.co/Zt8Yw3zuv9
Please don't do this Theresa. UK can work with US without praising him. Really hoping you are better than this https://t.co/RgMoTk9nth
Customs union is crucial for manufacturing. Asked Gov for specific Commons votes on it. Davis replies there will be. Am writing to clarify
'We're standing up to bullies': Yvette Cooper joins London Women's March | The Guardian https://t.co/lzJhfEkp43

Important point from @PRTuk - this yrs homicide figures include recording of the Hillsborough inquest - current cases up by 5% #crimestats https://t.co/d9AW4BxGWU
Crime stats also starting to show sheer scale of online crime &amp; fraud - 5.5m crimes last yr, nearly half of all crimes
Big increase in police recorded violent crime up 22% (inc troubling 22% rise in homicide, so clearly not just reporting changes) #crimestats https://t.co/X9XITl9iSv
Start of May speech says protect workers rights. End threatens to ditch them/UK model if we don't get deal we want. So much for protection!

V unwise of TMay to try to dismiss crisis in NHS - doesn't get what's happening in hospitals, with staff shortages &amp; big social care cuts
Good questions from @SophyRidgeSky this am but mainly fudged answers from PM. Still waiting for a Govt Brexit plan #ridge
This NHS crisis was predictable (and avoidable); staff shortages, big social care cuts, chaotic reorganisation - aka Tory Government
Thankyou @BritishRedCross for stepping in to help overstretched ambulance &amp; hospital trusts in crisis - but what the hell is Govt doing? https://t.co/ygkOnkVWab
Shocking. NHS crisis is so bad, Red Cross called in. CX says it's "responding to humanitarian crisis in our hospitals &amp; ambulance service" https://t.co/zgVolVFwbw

Astonishingly empty statement from Brexit Sec David Davis. No plan, no sense of grip, no detail. It's too important for this kind of drift
MPs here from all sides urging faster action to help child refugees. Amber Rudd's reply not good enough when lives &amp; safety are at risk
