A man who has worked at Honda in Swindon for 24 years, on finding out his factory will close and 3,500 jobs will be lost. This is gut-wrenching.   "They can't even decide for themselves what Brexit means. This is idiocy of epic proportions." https://t.co/xfWS5V5VD0
Dame Judith Hackitt, chair of manufacturing body EEF said "Let me be clear... for those hard Brexiteers who accuse us of scaremongering, this is very real and very serious."  Those politicians putting Eurosceptic ideology above jobs should be ashamed.  https://t.co/qMvJJx1dZe
We're 39 days away from Brexit. The government is yet to negotiate a deal that Parliament will ratify. The economy is stagnating. Businesses are leaving. Jobs are being destroyed. I am sharing this because there is still time to stop the country from making a historic mistake. https://t.co/7oudd1WIj0
Anyone who has not ruled out No Deal is putting Brexit above peace on the island of Ireland. It is shocking that the PM continues to say it is an option. For all our sakes, rule out No Deal. https://t.co/pnnMysINwh
@Dawn_Barnes @CatherineWest1 @HaringeyLibDems @TammyPalmerLD Surely this is way too important for cheap political point scoring. My views on Brexit and EU nationals are well known. Tonight I have been voting in Parliament and speaking about Knife crime and youth violence in the commons chamber. It‚Äôs 10.23pm and I am now on my way home.
This is an admission by the Home Secretary that leaving the EU with no deal will make the public less safe. Keeping it as an option is a dereliction of the first duty of government. With 39 days to go, no deal Brexit should have been ruled out.  https://t.co/f3z7DNDWb5
The only "lie" here is the idea that leaving the world's largest trading bloc would have no impact on jobs.   Investment in the UK car industry has halved in 2 years. The charlatans who conned the country should apologise and we should hold a public vote on the reality of Brexit. https://t.co/TQXEUBHlfv
Announced since November:  Honda close Swindon plant - 3500 jobs. Schaeffler and Michelin close UK factories - 1400 jobs. Philips close plant - 430 jobs. Jaguar Land Rover cuts - 4500 jobs. Ford cuts - 1000 jobs.  There is no such thing as a jobs-first Brexit. We must oppose it.
This is devastating news for the people of Swindon, and yet more bad news for the British manufacturing industry. 3,500 jobs more jobs are on the line. Do not let Brexiteers pretend for one second that this series of closures is a coincidence. https://t.co/7r7nRngJXg
Moving forward I hope we can contain this split by reaching out across the political spectrum in the Labour movement. Providing a platform for the likes of Tony Benn to Alan Milburn, our party has always succeeded as a broad and inclusive church.
I continue to believe that the Labour Party is the most powerful vehicle for progressive change in this country. However this is a moment for deep pause and reflection. We have been far too slow to tackle anti-Semitism in our party. We have failed to oppose Brexit.
I am very saddened that seven MPs have felt the need to leave Labour. As I have warned for months, I am concerned this split could keep Labour out of power for a generation. I hope we can reflect on this moment and don‚Äôt just knee jerk condemn these MPs. https://t.co/fq3NjSvkDg

No Deal Brexit is "the biggest threat businesses have faced since 1939, many are threatened with extinction" the CEO of the Food and Drink Federation tells #R4Today.  With 45 days to go, it is the Prime Minister's duty to rule this out this collasal act of self-harm.

My tweet was about health Dominic, but are you sure you want to brag about economics? Q4 2018 growth is estimated to have halved to 0.3%. In 2 years, investment in the car industry has also halved.

Social media is causing all kinds of social and mental health problems in our young people. One in four women between 16 and 24 suffer from anxiety, depression, phobias, or obsessive compulsive disorders. For young black men the context is different: it glamorises violence.
The Housing Crisis has created a vast polarity between different areas of London. Over the past 20 years the price of housing in London has quadrupled. Crime is highest in the deprived areas - and the number of young people in poverty is on the rise.
Neighbourhood policing - which provides a crucial link between communities and authorities - has also been dismantled. Since March 2015, the number of community support officers has fallen by 18% and 1/3 of street officers have been reassigned to other duties or left their jobs.
Local services have been savaged by cuts. Councils will see their budgets reduced by 54% from 2018-2020. Between 2012 and 2016, 600 youth centres closed, 3500 youth workers lost their jobs and 140,000 places for young people disappeared.
We need to get tougher on the adult gangsters and international organised criminals that exploit and pimp young teenage boys to run drugs.  Instead the UK Border Force has been cut by 18% since 2012-13. Cuts to funding to both support and challenge parents also don‚Äôt help.
The demand for drugs - particularly cocaine - has exploded. Prices are at their lowest levels in more than 25 years. There were 432 deaths relating to the use of Class A drugs in 2017, nearly quadruple the number in 2011.

When historians write about how we dealt with Brexit, they will be appalled at how little attention @theresa_may and Parliament paid to proven illegality in the 2016 Leave campaign. We need a British Mueller. https://t.co/B2xRLE1Ntv
Westminster, not Brussels, is responsible for these vast regional imbalances. Yes, we need to redistribute across the country, but impoverishing these regions through Brexit does the opposite. Labour MPs should show courage and say all this - not allow May to divide and rule.
I take no lectures from MPs happy to sell their constituencies down the river to take a one-off cash injection from the Tories. It won't make up for the disproportionate losses in GDP. Even with an FTA, the North West will shrink by 8%, the NE by 11%. https://t.co/TVvoQTeWm0
Throughout this period EU direct investment has been one of the most reliable sources of funding. The North East alone received ¬£1.1 billion in direct investment from the EU in the 5 years before 2016 - not to mention the 100,000 jobs in the region reliant on exports to Europe.
The 2008 crisis hit northern former industrial areas hardest, with the manufacturing sector losing 8.5% of its jobs. Tory austerity which followed dealt another disproportionate blow to the North, with spending falling by ¬£6.3bn since 2009/10, while it rose in the South.
Labour tried to restore these areas with regional development agencies and public sector investment - spending over ¬£2 billion per year on development in these regions in the later years of Labour government. Private sector still struggled. The Coalition government scrapped them.
Northern industrial areas were decimated by Thatcher. When she took power unemployment was at 1 million but that quickly tripled to 3 million in the early 80s. The proportion in the country living below the poverty line rose from 13% to 43%.
This is a slap in the face to Labour's inner city voters. Your argument relies on the false idea that all leave voters were from the industrial north. Actually most Brexit voters were from the Tory south: every part of the South except London voted Leave. https://t.co/EA3y579iP6
No Frank Field, my constituents are not "well provided for." 34% of Haringey residents are in poverty, we've had ¬£280 million cuts from local budgets and 791 knife crime offences last year. Not to mention black youth unemployment is over 2X average.  https://t.co/50Oa5J2EBp

Theresa May clueless at #pmqs about what changes she even wants to secure. Last night she showed she's prepared to drive the country off a cliff to keep her party together.   The time for indulging fantasy is over. The real alternative to May's deal is remaining in the EU.
Now Brexit Sec on #r4today says it's government policy to allow No Deal. Funny how he dismisses Parliament's vote against No Deal last night because it was not binding - and yet is happy to cause recession because of an advisory referendum won on the promise of a new deal.
Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay on #r4today was just asked to explain the government's alternative to the backstop. He could not answer and  replied it would "explore" different options. 58 days to go. This is a plan to keep the Tory Party together while trashing the country.

It is a stain on our nation that we are the only country in Europe which does not set a time limit on detention for those under immigration control. We must end this inhumane policy of indefinite detention now. #immigrationbill https://t.co/FRuNOH2xNH
I'm pleased that we are now voting against the government's Immigration Bill, but more than a little surprised we were planning to abstain on such a big issue in the first place.
If it was unclear before, there can be no doubt now. Brexit (and particularly No Deal) will be a wrecking ball to jobs, the economy and to the millions of people already struggling to pay the bills. Our democratic process will have failed if we do not give the public a #FinalSay. https://t.co/pdzLBO3mfk
I am very disappointed the Labour party is planning to abstain on the Immigration Bill. We should champion, celebrate and defend migrant rights and this bill - which comes from the most xenophobic British government in decades - severely undermines them.
The 1.2 million @BritishInEurope will inevitably see their own rights eroded too. Overnight they could lose their ability to live and work freely in Europe. Young people who overwhelming want the chance to live across the continent are having their horizons permanently narrowed.
It continues the inhumane practice of indefinite detention. We remain the only European country which does not set a time limit for detained migrants. This sullies our international reputation and undermines complaints we make about human rights abuses abroad.
It will force our NHS and other vital services into an even deeper staffing crisis. There are already 41,000 nursing vacancies in England. The salary threshold still under consideration would exclude many skilled medical staff, including nurses, paramedics and midwives.
The #immigrationbill being debated today is not fit for purpose. I will vote against it because it undermines the #citizensrights of 3.6m EU citizens in the UK, threatening to put many under the hostile environment and making them at risk of detention and deportation.
I will vote for any clause that gives the country freedom from @BorisJohnson. https://t.co/4gGndFtNb7

Theresa May has made a deal with the devil, trading her word and any remaining dignity she had left to delay the inevitable. Whether we vote next week or in January, her deal will not pass. It is time to legislate for a #PeoplesVote, to unblock our broken politics. #BrexitVote
Our politics is now well and truly stuck. The way to unblock it is to go back to the public with a People's Vote, which will either offer a mandate for a specific form of Brexit, or to remain in the EU.
The truth is that it's unlikely any form of Brexit could command a majority in this House. It is impossible to deliver on the 2016 referendum result because it was based on lies, false promises, and fantasy. No more negotiations in Brussels will change this fact.
If true, this is an unprecedented and historic humiliation for Theresa May. After two years of negotiations with the EU, she is not even prepared to let MPs vote on her deal. https://t.co/5NpiEgBoWd
After the Brexit deal is voted down and we have tried to secure a general election, Parliament's options will boil down to one of two: 1. Waste time amending May's doomed deal 2. Legislate for the ballot paper, timescales and procedures of a #PeoplesVote. I hope it is the latter.
Brexiters' repeated comparisons of the EU to Nazi Germany are a disingenuous and absurd distortion of a union set up to prevent extreme nationalism and fascism. The institution most responsible for Britain's national humiliation is the Conservative Party. https://t.co/o6ljn7GGC6

London rents have been out of control for years. This broken market has entrenched inequality and it is only getting worse. Some form of rent control - as in Berlin and New York - is long overdue.  https://t.co/wuCNxOiWoZ

The truth is that currently no specific form of Brexit has a clear majority in the commons. No re-negotiations or 'handbagging' by the PM will change this.

Theresa May is still legitimating the dangerous fantasy of No Deal on #r4Today. No responsible Prime Minister would do this. If her deal fails, she has failed and we must go back to the people to get a mandate for what to do next.
Do not ever let them get away with this lie again. 37 per cent of NHS doctors qualified overseas and migrants make up a disproportionate amount of care staff. We should welcome migrants. Our health service depends on it.   https://t.co/nJ8OHrUBHY

Brexit is a historic mistake.   It forgets the lessons of Britain‚Äôs past.   It forgets the value of immigrants.   It forgets that in the modern world our nation will not flourish through isolation. But connection, cooperation and a new vision for the common good. https://t.co/6a3jo7CCRw
Chilling that Theresa May simply dismisses the UN's report which said the government's "punitive, mean-spirited and often callous‚Äù austerity policies are inflicting ‚Äúgreat misery‚Äù on the British people. Poverty is rampant in this country and needs to be radically addressed. #PMQs
Our country‚Äôs story of renewal through Europe is a story of immigration.   Over their lifetimes, EU citizens pay in ¬£78,000 more than they take out.

The Brexiteers say we lost control because of the EU. But in reality they are still mourning Suez, Britain‚Äôs last fling of the Colonial dice.  Today we need to build a new image of Britain.

Even after the scandal broke, the Home Office has shown a "surprising lack of urgency to identify other groups that may have been affected." The department is more interested in covering its own back than uncovering the truth.
The Home Office ignored warnings and recommendations for years. Rather than admitting its wrongs, it subjected British citizens to the brutal Hostile Environment. We still don't know how deep this goes. So far just 18 have had apologies.
This report confirms the grim truth we already knew. The Home Office failed to protect Windrush citizens' "rights to live, work and access services" and "discharged its duty of care." It is a national disgrace. https://t.co/ddZL0dpoGZ

This is very important. The threat of No Deal is greatly reduced. Parliament is taking back control from a Conservative Party in government but losing power fast. When Parliament takes back control, we should then give it back to the country with the option to remain. https://t.co/uz965SaEXZ

Sajid Javid attempts to defend his "sick Asian paedophiles" tweet before expressing dismay at the racist bullying which still exists in our schools. The two are connected. Xenophobic language from politicians can lead to violence on the playground. #r4today
Sajid Javid on #R4Today boasts the government "will bring a complete end to freedom of movement". Chilling that he has such pride in clipping the wings of British people who want to work abroad, while blocking the workers our economy and ageing population needs.
Racial prejudice continues to weigh on the lives of black and ethnic minority people in the UK. We share the same hard-won rights, but our experiences are too often shaped by bias. Pretending to be colour blind has not worked. We need to talk about and properly understand race.
25% of BAME people said they had been refused entrance or asked to leave a restaurant, bar or club for no good reason. This compares to just 9% of white people.
38% of BAME people said they had been wrongly suspected of shoplifting in the last five years, compared with 14% of white people.
43% of ethnic minorities asked had been overlooked for a work promotion in a way that felt unfair in the past five years ‚Äì just 18% of white people felt the same.
12% of the 1,000 BAME people surveyed heard racist language directed at them in the previous month. 43% had experienced it in the past five years.

Theresa May has no right to say we will leave the EU at any cost on 29 March. If her deal does not make it through Parliament, MPs will decide what happens next.

This deal ends your opportunity to live and work freely across Europe, will gut jobs in the service sector, and may cause splits in our union.  It gives away UK influence over EU rules, while making us a rule-taker.   It is deeply unpopular with both leavers and remainers. https://t.co/3aLvtefB8t

Unbelievable. Matt Hancock on #r4Today still parroting the same lines that the deal allows us to "take back control" and is "good for the economy".  It leaves us a passive rule taker and imposes new barriers to services, which make up 80% of our economy. This must be stopped.
At Lancaster House, May said she would get a ‚Äúbold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement."  She has failed. All we've got is 7 vague pages setting our intention to secure a future relationship. This is a step into the dark with a blind fold on. #r4Today

May is desperate to frame the #PeoplesVote as a "re-run". The problem is the #BrexitDeal she has brought back from Brussels is nothing like the fantasy promised in 2016. Just ask Boris Johnson. Time to let the people decide whether leaving the EU is still worth it. #PMQs
It is as simple as this. If May really believes her deal is good for the country and "delivers on the will of the British people" she would put it to the test in the first referendum on the reality of Brexit. Anything less is cowardice #PMQs

It has been six months since I first raised this in Parliament .There is still no hardship fund, still no compensation scheme, and still no final figure for the number impacted. History will judge this government poorly for its shocking mistreatment and abuse of its own citizens.
I am disgusted, but not surprised, that @sajidjavid tried to sneak this news out tonight without even a statement in Parliament. It is yet another insult to the Windrush generation to which he promised to "do right".
Our own citizens were sent across the ocean without a penny in their pockets. The same ocean Britain took their ancestors across in chains on slave ships. Thousands of victims walk among us: destitute, homeless, jobless; still waiting for the compensation they need and deserve.
This is a national disgrace. Each case is a shocking indictment of a government pandering to far right xenophobia, bogus immigration targets and the dog whistle of the right wing press.
Tonight @ukhomeoffice revealed that 83 British citizens, at least 8 of whom are dead, were victims of Theresa May‚Äôs ‚Äòdeport first ask questions later‚Äô hostile environment. This number will continue to rise as more cases are identified. (https://t.co/QYPO3xKxNC ‚Ä¶)

The Tories are increasingly desperate to frame Brexit as a choice between no deal and a bad deal.  As the Labour Party's conference resolution states, if the government is confident in its deal, it "should not be afraid to put that deal to the public" via a #PeoplesVote. https://t.co/DFa8iYZpvh

Corbyn right to point out the Chancellor's failure to announce a Windrush hardship fund at #Budget2018. Those made homeless, jobless, and destitute because of government failure are still waiting for compensation. They are still waiting for justice.
At #Budget2018 the Chancellor has the nerve to talk about "Britain‚Äôs jobs miracle." Tell that to the eight million working-age adults living in poverty. Tell that to the thousands in manufacturing, in retail and in the city who have lost jobs as firms relocate because of Brexit.
George Osborne said he'd eliminate the deficit by 2015. The Tories are stuck on repeat and have run out of ideas. #Budget2018 https://t.co/qkJ3fBWeAx
At #Budget2018 Hammond talks about "an economy back on its feet again" and a "deal dividend." Has Boris been messing around with his spreadsheets? The British economy has the slowest growth in the G20.

Rebecca Sheeran of the national audit office on border security following Brexit on #r4today "any weaknesses or gaps ... could quickly be exploited by organised criminals".  This is a deriliction of the government's first duty: to keep the British public safe.

As no existing institutions are both able and willing to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 referendum, a Mueller-style inquiry has to be the next step.   This is not a partisan issue: foreign meddling in our democracy should concern us all. https://t.co/p9XgFI68SF
Theresa May is already visibly frustrated by repeated calls for a #PeoplesVote from all sides of the House. It's going to be a long winter...
The Prime Minister would rather throw the country into recession than pause for more time. Why? She puts party before country every single time. https://t.co/VUTTcf3y98
Even if May agrees an Irish border solution with the EU, there remains one monumental problem she can't surmount. Her fudge deal is not what anyone voted for in 2016, and both Parliament and the public oppose it. The only solution to this parliamentary deadlock is a #PeoplesVote. https://t.co/N1GhYxZGw2
The EU's advantage in negotiations was obvious from the start. It is one country versus 27. When you sold Brexit to the nation as an easy fix to our problems, you were either lying or incredibly naive. Which was it? https://t.co/tQLTPwJF5n

@carolecadwalla @campbellclaret Yes, as soon as I'm in on Monday.
Shouldn't we check with the British people if they really want to "go down fighting", disproportionately impoverishing the vulnerable, all for a worse set of international trade agreements?  All recent polls show a clear majority support a #PeoplesVote and remaining in the EU. https://t.co/Vzcv7g1NQ2
Yet to hear Matt Hancock mention one single advantage of Theresa May's Brexit deal over our current position as a leading rule-maker within the world's largest single trading bloc. This government has abandoned the national interest #Marr
Stop and search is inherently unfair, unjust and ineffectual. Even Theresa May agrees.  So why is @sajidjavid extending this practice?  By ignoring the evidence and pandering to the right of the Tory party, the Home Sec risks deepening societies divides.  https://t.co/QHMzKq7Hig
Emily Thornberry is absolutely right on #Marr when she says the government's framing of no deal or a bad deal is a "false choice".  Britain still has every right to reject Brexit altogether through a #PeoplesVote with the right to remain in the EU.
The "political sensitivities" surrounding laws broken in the 2016 referendum give more reason not less for the Met to act urgently.  The impact of these crimes could be felt for generations. As Collins says, "What is our law worth if the police won‚Äôt act?" https://t.co/BBHoxGLYBq

If May's deal is defeated, Brexit can be stopped. The government is committed to tabling an amendment on how it intends to proceed. Parliament will vote on this as a motion. We can push for a People's Vote amendment on this motion. https://t.co/jYr6mEze7V

Empty words will be the defining words of Theresa May's premiership. Austerity is not over. Real terms pay cuts for public service workers and a chronic lack of investment will continue to starve our society and entrench inequality #pmqs.
Post-slavery, traditional nuclear families were not always the norm in Caribbean communities, because some had to separate to escape the suffocating poverty that still characterised their existence.   Lone parent families reflected an economic strategy, not a cultural trait.
If you are teaching about Caribbean communities, you have to teach the context. That context is brutal. A brutality that leaves a legacy. It is about slavery. About families who had no chance to stay together because their freedom was not their own.  https://t.co/vIpbo2taBM

Steve Baker on #r4today may be "unafraid to go ahead without an agreement," but it is not him who will suffer. One estimate puts the cost of no-deal at ¬£1,000 per household per year. This will disproportionately hurt the poorest families.
The choice is not between no deal and the "pragmatic" choice of Theresa May's deal, as Laura Kuenssberg implies on #r4today. A #PeoplesVote is hugely popular in the country and the only pragmatic choice that puts the national interest first.

39% of the time the Met's use of force was on black people, who make up only about 13% of London‚Äôs population.   Systemic bias still permeates each stage of the criminal justice system. More needs to be done to root it out.

I believe the worst-case figure the Bank of England used was 35% and an accompanying recession deeper than 2008.

Theresa May will go down in history as the Prime Minister who closed down opportunity. For young people to live and work freely in Europe.

The Prime Minister announces the end of Free Movement as though it's an exciting new policy on #r4today.  This is national self-sabotage that will lock us out of the world's largest single trading block, and deny British people the right to work and travel freely across Europe.
Tory migration policy is a farce. You've failed to bring it below 100,000 every year since 2010.  The Prime Minister should admit that's because migration has been great for this country. Our economy, hospitals, and businesses depend on high numbers. https://t.co/uCsqx3DEqp

Richard, there can be no GE without a vote in Parliament. Can you name one Tory or DUP MP who's said they would vote for one? It‚Äôs like asking turkeys to vote for Christmas.  Several Tories however have already called for a People‚Äôs Vote. Time to get real. https://t.co/XQxP50Jh8P

Theresa May's tough guy act is fooling no one. Her deal has disintegrated and she has nothing left but empty threats. We've got six weeks of negotiating time left and no proposals on the table. The only feasible option is to give the power back to the people with a new vote.
Theresa May repeats the hard eurosceptic spin that the referendum was a vote to leave the customs union. Nonsense. No specific form of Brexit was on the ballot paper and no-one voted for the no deal we're on track for. This is precisely why we need a #PeoplesVote.
We do not have to do this.   #PeoplesVote.  https://t.co/Ebw5Obm1lX

To those saying we need a GE not a #PeoplesVote - I want rid of this awful Tory govt more than anyone.  But we need to get real. Tory &amp; DUP MPs are not going to vote for a GE in a month of Sundays.   Far more likely some vote for a referendum amendment - if so, the govt collapses

Theresa May is now the walking wounded. With one breath Donald Tusk blew over her house of cards. Johnson and Rees-Mogg are like vultures surrounding their prey. They want a no-deal Brexit at the cost of jobs, the NHS and the economy.   A People's Vote is our only path to safety.

I'm not ignoring anyone. The government's Brexit deal will look nothing like the fantasy a small majority voted for in 2016. People deserve the chance to accept or reject it.  This will be the first democratic vote on the reality of Brexit. What are you so afraid of? https://t.co/Ys6Ap3DFA7

Leavers said BMW would make sure there's a post-Brexit deal. In the words of David Davis, the UK is "too valuable a market for Europe to shut off."  Working people are already having to suffer for the arrogance of the Brextremist ideological project. It makes the blood boil! https://t.co/sXfy9ufxFq
Brexit was never really about taking back control.   It's about handing over the NHS to foreign competition, starting a bonfire of consumer and environmental regulations, and taking rights away from workers.   We do not have to do this.   https://t.co/A9ctcLsG80
The Migration Advisory Committee's report highlights the sheer dishonesty in the government's approach to migration. All the evidence shows both EU and non-EU migrants are hugely beneficial to the UK. Almost every politician knows this, but many are afraid to tell the truth.
The Migration Advisory Committee report today debunks Farage's nonsense world view:  - EU migrants contribute much more to the NHS than they consume &amp; pay more in taxes than they take in benefits. - Migration has no or little impact on unemployment, wages and has reduced prices.

Unlike the 2008 crisis, no-deal Brexit would be a deliberate political choice.  Do not forget there are two options if the government fails to get a deal. Leave &amp; make everyone poorer, or extend Article 50 and campaign in a #PeoplesVote to stay in the EU. https://t.co/MJVJtIg8Am

Offers from kind individuals to pay for Mr Vanriel's flight home restore my faith in humanity, but should not be necessary.

It's clear a no-deal Brexit will be catastrophic. But the govt's release of "contingency plans" is just a pathetic attempt to make whatever deal they bring back look slightly less crap. Raab is the spokesman of a desperate govt that has dug itself a hole, with no plan to get out.
Dominic Raab says "the UK will be better off outside the EU in any scenario..." This is not reasoned, intelligent government. This is ideological extremism in favour of Brexit at any cost to our schools, hospitals, businesses, culture and everything that makes this country great.
Over the past 2 years, the Leave campaign has been exposed for breaking the law, its promises have been shown impossible to deliver &amp; the govt looks incapable of negotiating a deal at a car boot sale.  It's no wonder public opinion has shifted. A #PeoplesVote is the only option. https://t.co/iJyojP6Xlk
If the government really wants to take back control, they need to learn to take back responsibility too. Blaming Brussels for a no-deal Brexit is like demanding a divorce and then blaming your ex-spouse when you feel lonely.  https://t.co/6tJQoRAqQs

How many have been left jobless, homeless, denied benefits and left destitute because of your department's errors? Why is there no hardship fund right now for those in financial ruin through no fault of their own? And when will they finally receive full compensation?
But while I have you, can you answer some of the Qs I've been asking you and your government since April? Exactly how many have been detained, deported &amp; refused re-entry following Home Office hounding?
.@Sajidjavid: I didn't mention Tories or Govt. I blamed the Home Office &amp; I stand by that. I've been frank about failures of successive Govt's.

Home Office covering up scale of the scandal by consistently refusing to answer my questions, including those to the PM back in April. This will all be viewed as just spin until every single person affected gets an apology and compensation. https://t.co/BelOGNYbfy

Bizarre anti-business rant from Ian Duncan Smith on #r4today, who says the 130,000 firms consulted by the CBI "have not even bothered" to hire British people. His form of petty nationalism will bring this country to its knees.

To refer to race is not in itself racist. It's racist to suggest one group's opinions are more valid because that group is superior, i.e. the construct that justified colonialism. It's not racist to suggest one group's opinions are more valid b/c of lived experience of prejudice.
Anyone is free to have an opinion on what constitutes racism/Islamophobia, but it takes staggering arrogance for a man who has been part of a movement whipping up hatred against minorities and immigrants to start pronouncing on racism/Islamophobia.
Muslim women are the most economically disadvantaged people in the UK - they are three times more likely to be unemployed jobseekers. To mock their clothes and compare them to bank robbers shows a complete disdain for this and their other disadvantages. https://t.co/SPExoSg85x

The debate again demonstrates a total lack of understand about the impact and legacy of colonialism. Both in terms of why there are people of African heritage living in France and why those people may choose to celebrate their African heritage in light of that history. (7)
If white Europeans want to tell the descendants of colonised peoples what their identity should and shouldn‚Äôt be then good effing luck to you. (6)
We are so far away from integration, by definition, if the first response to a World Cup victory is a debate about whether the players are African. (5)
If we do not celebrate immigration and diversity, the far right will exploit it. We shouldn‚Äôt need a World Cup victory, or Olympic gold medals, or Spider-Man saving a child from a tower block, or a Windrush scandal to do this. (4)
People of African heritage from around the world, including the US, should of course celebrate the success of people of African heritage. That does not mean they are denying their French identity. (3)
The nation is not an ethno-state. The England team is black, brown, mixed, white, working class, Afro-Caribbean and more. This is England and it‚Äôs beautiful. (2)
Nailed it @Trevornoah. Being French and being proud of African identity is not mutually exclusive. But this debate has treated those things as such. French does not = ethnic French. (1)  https://t.co/dXMr5KDghR

I have been granted an Urgent Question at 10.30 on @sajidjavid's cynical decision to bury the Home Office's admission of failures over the Hostile Environment during the England match. The Home Secretary promised to do "right" by the Windrush generation, but already he's failed.
England out. Trump in. Govt's Brexit white paper arrives in Brussels. Home Office tries to bury its Hostile Environment failures in all the bad news. We deserve so much better than this.

Separate data from Sky shows a majority (54%) of Britons think Windrush scandal is not a price worth paying for tackling illegal immigration. https://t.co/ZBFBTjjCjq
And the link between Brexit and immigration has been exaggerated - 2/3 of the greatest rises in support for leaving the EU have been among those who think migrants have NO effect on the economy (+28) or British culture (+21). https://t.co/1X74ftMwpE
Over time, there has been clear trend towards a majority who recognise immigration's positive impact on BOTH our culture and the economy.   (data from the British Social Attitudes Survey: https://t.co/RZGAnm5xT7). https://t.co/rTbYkrGsCj
Govt politicians won't admit it because it doesn't fit their narrative, but there has been a dramatic shift to British public attitudes, in FAVOUR of immigration since Brexit and Windrush. A thread: https://t.co/aBNbHiGk8d

Privately educated, ex-stock broker, Nigel ‚ÄòMan of the people‚Äô Farage said Brexit left him "skint." The truth is he earns hundreds of thousands per year. He‚Äôs lucky he can fall back on his 2nd job and EU pension, while the poorest pay for his Brexit mess. https://t.co/hxiCQKdxON

Ultimately, it is the govt which has responsibility for this shipwreck. Outside of reshuffles, this is the first time two cabinet ministers have quit within 24 hours of each other since 1979. Gaping holes in the cabinet cannot be plugged by meaningless platitudes.
69% of the British people think Brexit is going badly. There's a 23 point margin in favour of those who want a say on the final deal. How much further must public opinion shift? With the govt collapsing, I asked the Prime Minister to get the message and support a #PeoplesVote https://t.co/EnMwJpBeVt
Don't let anyone fool you, Boris Johnson and David Davis are not principled. They are the two cowardly captains who take the first lifeboat to safety, as the rest of Britain continues full-steam ahead into the oncoming iceberg of Brexit.

Back when Dominic Raab labelled feminists "obnoxious bigots," Theresa May rightly slapped him down as "not the way forward." Why have you now given this dinosaur one of the biggest jobs in government, @theresa_may? https://t.co/a3xJhioYNy
Raab's description of food bank visitors as those with temporary "cashflow problems" shows a complete failure to understand the difficulties of working people in this country. The very people who will be economically knee-capped by Brexit.
At this time of political turmoil we need clear thinking, but Raab represents the very worst of hard Brexit ideology. Last year he made up that immigration pushed up ‚Äúhouse prices up by something like 20%.‚Äù The country deserves better than this
If Dominic Raab is as successful as Brexit Secretary as he was as Housing Minister, we will have a #PeoplesVote by Christmas.
Now the Home Office is refusing visa extensions to allow the children of #Grenfell victims to attend the public inquiry. This is inhumane from @sajidjavid, who has kept the Hostile Environment policy alive in all but name. https://t.co/vfcR3RcjvP

Qs John Humphrys would have asked Davis if we did not live in a chumocracy:  1. Why didn‚Äôt you negotiate a feasible plan in the last 2 years?  2. Will you call for vote of no confidence in Theresa May?  3. How does your hard Brexit avoid a recession and a hard border in Ireland?
David Davis on #r4today is a man who can't take responsibility. For two years he's been in charge of Brexit. No one in the world is as much to blame for this monumental mess as himself.
What's certain is that the Chequers deal will not be accepted by the commons. This makes No Deal more likely, and a Meaningful Vote vital. At this point another General Election or a #PeoplesVote become very likely.
Looking forward, David Davis' resignation will have enormous consequences on Brexit. Theresa May could face a vote of confidence if Davis, Rees-Mogg and co. rally enough rebellion among backbenchers. Even if May wins, the scraps of authority she has left will be in tatters.
Brexit always made more sense as a protest position for a rabble of Tory backbenchers. As an actual policy it is a disaster. The EU has always been a whipping boy for mendacious national politicians, not the real problem. David Davis' resignation proves this.
Friday: Theresa May - ‚Äúwe are now a cabinet of collective responsibility‚Äù.  Sunday: David Davis resigns.  Britain deserves better than this. Time for a @UKLabour Government.

Under New Labour, spending on the NHS more than doubled. These spending increases eclipsed the Coaltion and Conservative governments that followed #NHS70 https://t.co/Nttz04gLU7

850 people were mistakenly detained by the Home Office. Let that sink in. Under Hostile Environment innocent people have been locked up &amp; deported. We need an independent review of the hostile environment policy before more lives are torn apart @sajidjavid https://t.co/LOX7Fvwlew

On the anniversary of Windrush, we recommit our pledge to protect and defend the rights of the Windrush generation and we celebrate the strength and unity of our diverse country. https://t.co/jwXs4NCi8L
The language in this front page is remarkably similar to that of Trump saying Mexicans were ‚Äòbringing drugs, crime and rapists‚Äô. In the words of Martin Luther King: ‚ÄúWe must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools‚Äù.
The Daily Mail could have run headline today celebrating 70th anniversary of first #Windrush ship arriving in the UK &amp; the amazing contribution those onboard have made ever since. Instead they continue to whip up anti-immigrant rhetoric in support of the PM‚Äôs hostile environment. https://t.co/4lEIHouMY5
Above all, today I pay tribute to them. I think of my 28 constituents with ongoing cases and the thousands of other Commonwealth-born Britons who still live in fear of the Hostile Environment.
The anniversary of Windrush is bittersweet. The victims of this crisis, people who have given so much and asked for so little, are still facing desperate uncertainty.
The Windrush Taskforce, specially appointed to support victims of the scandal, has repeatedly breached their two-week deadline for resolving cases. More than a hundred citizens are still waiting for appointments with the Home Office weeks after they first contacted them.
Those victims have still not seen justice, and the Government‚Äôs response to the crisis continues to be inadequate. There is still no hardship fund for victims of the scandal. People made destitute by the Home Office are forced to wait months and months for compensation.
The Hostile Environment denied Windrush citizens access to public services to which so many had dedicated their lives. Nurses, train drivers &amp; public sector workers were told that their contributions were null and void and that they should leave this country immediately.
The Britain to which they contributed so much has failed them. Seventy years on from the arrival of HMT Windrush, the Government thanked the Windrush generation for their service to this country by throwing them into detention centres, and deporting them.
Britain called, and they came. They came because they wanted to rebuild post-war Britain. And they came because three centuries of colonial rule had stripped the Caribbean of much of its wealth and resources and left behind significant unemployment.
Those on board HMT Windrush were invited here to rebuild a Britain crippled by war: a Britain facing chronic shortages of staff, with a dream of ‚Äòhealthcare for all‚Äô but no way of making it happen.
I think of the thousands of transport workers who were recruited directly from Bridgetown and Kingston, and who for 70 years worked as bus and train drivers, and cleaners and wardens, in Britain‚Äôs stations and on Britain‚Äôs streets.
My thoughts go out to the thousands of people who came before 1971, to form the backbone of our public services in Britain. I think of the nurses like my aunts, who I watched work late nights and early shifts with incredible pride and dignity.
Thread: On the anniversary of Windrush, I remember the contributions of the 492 West Indian immigrants who arrived at Tilbury Docks on 22nd June 1948, and of the 524,000 Commonwealth-born people who followed until 1971.
Today is a moment to celebrate the people who gave so much and took so little, but it is bittersweet. The fight for justice goes on, as does the fight for compensation, reparation and redress for thousands of our fellow citizens who have suffered at the hands of the government. https://t.co/LaEEP1CLhy
Theresa May is reportedly attending the Windrush 70th anniversary service at Westminster Abbey this morning. I hope they ask for 4 pieces of evidence for each year she has lived in the country at the door. Her taxi is waiting outside already. https://t.co/P1MyfaMZZr
No @EstherMcVey1, you‚Äôre building a system that‚Äôs left thousands of people in debt, pushed a million into foodbanks &amp; costs more than what it replaced. This is the stuff of Dickensian Britain and nothing like what we should be seeing in the 21st century.  https://t.co/m0hbyshRQ5

The extra ¬£20bn for the NHS has exposed that the pain inflicted by austerity was a political choice, rather than a necessity. 8 years of crippling cuts, nurses forced to go to foodbanks, historically long waiting lists, all the unnecessary results of a failed economic plan.
This is all pie in the sky. There is no Brexit dividend. The Labour manifesto set out how it would fund the NHS, rather than resorting to fantasy. https://t.co/UAfDXt3sQU
To properly honour the Windrush generation, it is vital that their contributions &amp; history are included in our national curriculum. British students need to understand the painful realities of slavery and empire &amp; Britain's role in it.
Good news that Britain will celebrate Windrush citizens with a Windrush Day, and that the Govt. will give ¬£500k grant.   Still waiting for the announcement that the Govt will give Windrush citizens made destitute &amp; homeless by the Home Office access to a hardship fund.
Shambolic scenes this morning as even the Health Secretary has to admit that it‚Äôs unlikely the Brexit dividend actually exists. Where will the ¬£20bn come from then? Could it be that tax rises and borrowing will fund our NHS after all? https://t.co/TYdXNMdHax

I‚Äôve always been absolutely clear. I don‚Äôt pretend to have a sober neutrality on the subject of #Grenfell. I lost a friend, my wife lost a mentee &amp; an intern that she‚Äôd known for many years &amp; watched flourish. Khadija died at the beginning of what looked like a fantastic career. https://t.co/3LE6D7FTeH
One year on from Grenfell, I pay tribute to the community of North Kensington and people of all faiths and none who came together as one in the aftermath of such great tragedy. We must reflect upon and regain that unity in support of the Grenfell families. https://t.co/HMCPfJQzpm
Today, one year on from the Grenfell Tower fire, we renew our commitment to the fight for justice on behalf of those who died, their families and loved ones. It was my privilege and a huge honour to speak at the Grenfell memorial service earlier today. https://t.co/67BUpxOISy
May you Rest in Peace Khadija Saye. Khadija was a beautiful soul and a visionary young artist whose life was tragically cut short by the Grenfell Tower fire. The loss of a young woman with so much talent, joy and beauty is heart-breaking and tragic. https://t.co/JswYWBtGOq
When I stood at the foot of the smouldering Tower last June, I could never have imagined that so many people affected would be so badly let down 12 months on. We must use this anniversary to renew our commitment to justice for the victims. https://t.co/2RahDc0IuH
Agree with @HackneyAbbott. Grenfell exposed huge gaps in a society that is losing its mixed communities. A borough of townhouses and tower blocks: streets apart, but worlds away. We must have an inquiry into the role of race and class in Grenfell Tower. https://t.co/rkNAcgyQtL
Taken one year ago at the foot of Grenfell Tower. https://t.co/ZQZb88YpUu
Those responsible still walk free, one year on. 12 months have gone by and there has been no ban on dangerous cladding. 52 weeks and many victims are in hotel rooms waiting to be rehoused. Still no justice, still no peace. https://t.co/RCthWW0li9
Heartwarming displays of solidarity throughout London. Today, we stand together demanding justice for victims &amp; their families. We demand that the Govt keep their promises, the state which has failed them commits to change &amp; above all that the voices of the victims are heard. https://t.co/ADznzuAzFx
This anniversary is a time to reflect on how little has changed in the last year and renew our commitment to fighting for justice on behalf of those who lost their lives, those who survived, and all those people whose lives were irreversibly changed last June.
One year on the government must reflect on their failings and the fact that those who made it out of the tower alive have been let down again and again by broken promises. They remain ignored and had to fight to even to get representation on the inquiry conducted on their behalf.
One year on, the Government has failed to act to prevent another Grenfell Tower: after initially refusing to fund the refurbishment of tower blocks covered in combustible cladding that failed fire safety tests, thousands of people are still living in unsafe homes.
This missed opportunity is a tragedy in and of itself.  One year on, the Government has failed to ban the flammable and combustible cladding that caused the largest death toll in a single incident in London since the Second World War.
As regeneration becomes gentrification and mixed communities cease to exist, Grenfell could have served as a call to action to put the ‚Äòsocial‚Äô back into housing and a turning point to end the supremacy of the market in the provision of homes in this country.
Grenfell represented a breakdown in the social contract between the state and the individual. If anything positive could have come out of what happened last June, Grenfell would have sparked a renewed commitment to housing as a social good, not merely as a for-profit asset.
I had hoped that the disaster would be a watershed moment in our national life where we reflected upon the importance of social housing and reconsidered the role of the private sector and profiteering in the delivery of our public services.
Those responsible for this tragedy are still walking free, and justice will not be done on behalf of all those who died until those responsible are stood in the dock at the Old Bailey in front of a judge and jury facing charges of gross negligence manslaughter.
There is still no culpability for what happened at Grenfell, and we have heard very little about the criminal investigation to hold those responsible to account and bring them to justice.
T he Prime Minister told them that they would be rehoused in three weeks after the tragedy. It has been 52 weeks and dozens of households are still waiting to be rehoused. I am appalled that survivors will be spending the one year anniversary of Grenfell in a cramped hotel room.
People who were failed by the state and burnt out of their homes have been failed by the state again and again. Survivors have had to contend with more than one can imagine whilst grieving for their loved ones and trying to rebuild their lives.
The government should and must be judged on its handling of the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower tragedy over the course of the last year, and clearly they have failed miserably in their duty to the Grenfell survivors.
When I stood at the foot of the smouldering tower last June, it did not strike me as remotely possible that so many people could be so badly let down, and that people who made it out of the tower that night would still be living in a bed and breakfast today.
One year on from the Grenfell Tower we must reflect on the fact that the government has gravely failed the survivors. Every promise that the government has made has subsequently been broken.
Like so many others who did not make it out of Grenfell Tower Khadija was denied a future and the opportunity to pursue her hopes and dreams.
Khadija was a beautiful soul &amp; visionary artist who was at the beginning of what would have been a wonderful career. Her life was tragically cut short and the loss of a young woman with so much talent and joy at the age of 24 is a tragic ordeal for her family &amp; friends to endure.
Justice for Grenfell. My statement on the one year anniversary:   Today my thoughts and prayers go out to Khadija Saye, all those who lost their lives in Grenfell Tower and their families and loved ones who are grieving and coming to terms with what happened one year ago.

@Homeofficeuk‚Äôs dystopian Hostile Environment has bankrupted innocent people, forced them into rent arrears &amp; pushed them out onto the streets. Yet victims are still being punished. They are still without any compensation or justice. It is vital the Govt set up a hardship fund.

If your Windrush case has missed the two week @ukhomeoffice deadline please email me so I can get a sense of numbers. @LucyMPowell @JCWI_UK @helenhayes_ @HackneyAbbott @Afzal4Gorton
And the question that @ukhomeoffice must answer (I have already tabled PQs to ask them) is how many Windrush cases are being dealt with within the 2 week deadline? If 100% of my cases are missing the deadline this represents systemic failure and will be the same across the board.
I know @YvetteCooperMP is going to pursue these issues through the Home Affairs Select Committee and scrutinise this guidance published by the Home Office. Also worth following @ameliagentleman @JCWI_UK @RunnymedeTrust @TheVoiceNews @Praxis_Projects. This is not going away. (11)
By the end of today, 12 Windrush cases that I have sent to @ukhomeoffice @sajidjavid Commonwealth Taskforce will have passed the government's own deadline of two weeks without resolution. They won't reply to my letters so please can you intervene Home Secretary? (10)
I am still waiting for a response from @sajidjavid to my letter that I wrote to him on 11th May calling on him to introduce a hardship fund to support Windrush citizens who are destitute, homeless and hungry because of the Home Office. (9) https://t.co/LCecpJPgrx
When @sajidjavid said that Windrush citizens wouldn't have to pay any fees it appears he didn't read @ukhomeoffice guidance, which says that "any passport applications requires the applicant to pay the appropriate fee". (8) https://t.co/2HA4TPaODR
It turns out that the 'free' citizenship with no fees can be refused to people who have spent 90 days abroad. How many other British citizens have their citizenship questioned if they spent time living or working abroad? What is different about Windrush citizens? (7) https://t.co/9M5grG65oJ
Pages 29-41 are redacted by @ukhomeoffice - that is 25% of the entire guidance document that they do not want the public and Windrush citizens to see. There is no transparency and accountability - what exactly are they hiding? (6) https://t.co/HxST6fIFnD
And how many other British citizens can have their British citizenship denied because of an arbitrary 'good character' test decided by a Home Office caseworker with no right of appeal? (5)
Many Windrush citizens, including my constituents, have fallen into arrears and debt because they have been denied their rights to work - are they now going to be punished again and denied their citizenship because of the Home Office's incompetence? (4)
Citizenship can only be granted to someone of 'good character'. This is arbitrary &amp; unfair. If someone is in debt then @ukhomeoffice can reject their case. What if they built up debts because they were unable to work and claim benefits because of the Home Office @sajidjavid? (3) https://t.co/ysBwQIkQ9a
There is no right of appeal or review for Windrush cases. Given @ukhomeoffice shocking track record in wrongfully deporting and detaining people, they clearly cannot be trusted to not make mistakes that will ruin more lives. Why no right of appeal @sajidjavid @carolinenokes? (2) https://t.co/oEK4DY7sWF

It should not be controversial to say that ‚Äòmerit‚Äô means the kid who gets straight A* and A grades despite living in a council tower block and attending a school in special measures, not just the kid who has the very best private education, tutoring and support money can buy.
Nobody is asking Cambridge or Oxford to reduce grades or compromise academic excellence. I am asking them to do the exact opposite and recognise that ‚Äòmerit‚Äô is the kid who gets straight A* and A grades from a disadvantaged background, a tough school and deprived community.
If Cambridge is serious about access then instead of an open letter the University needs to put its money where its mouth is and introduce a University-wide foundation year in addition to systemic reform of its admissions system: centralised admissions, not college admissions.
Instead of spin and massaging the figures the universities need to face up to their own institutional failings and ask tough questions about its admissions process.
Very little has changed since I first submitted FOI requests to Oxbridge for their access data in 2010. We have seen minor progress but both universities remain institutions defined by entrenched privilege and the preserve of wealthy white students from London and the South East.
If they refuse to change and fail to make serious progress on access then there is no good reason why the taxpayer should continue to fund them to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds every year.
We need systemic change, not piecemeal PR exercises  It is not up to Cambridge to "call on" anyone to do anything. They are an institution funded by the taxpayer and must be held to account as such.
My response to this quite extraordinary open letter published earlier today:   Instead of looking to blame the applicants, schools and everyone apart from themselves, it would be more helpful if both Cambridge and Oxford focused attention on reforming their admissions processes. https://t.co/UShIzpTPdu

Well, quite. https://t.co/RktD2yBG88
Exactly. Look at the data - it‚Äôs all there. White applicants 33% more likely to get an offer than BAME students. White applications twice as likely as Black British applicants. Some colleges white applicants 4 or 5 times more likely to get a place. Oxford needs to explain this. https://t.co/yDXETG4gD6

Thanks for the email @ThangamMP. Windrush citizen in Bristol who has had this ESA stopped last November. Contacted the taskforce on 23.04 and no response despite chasing from the MP. Two more constituents waiting a month with no response. What happened to 2 weeks @carolinenokes?
Home Office email tells us that "the call for evidence will be followed by a full consultation on the details of the compensation scheme". Great. How many months will that take? What about a hardship fund for those left destitute by your Home Office, @sajidjavid? That would help.
Just received another awful email from @ukhomeoffice about "support for Commonwealth citizens". 1) you are already beyond your 2 week deadline 2) your "consultation" doesn't help people who are destitute because of the Home Office. Stop wasting my time with these pathetic emails.

2 of my constituents have already had to wait longer than the deadline set out by @carolinenokes and @sajidjavid. @ukhomeoffice say there is an "enormous backlog". Well yes, quite, I am sure there is a bit of a backlog as a result of you stripping citizens of their rights.
My constituent (Windrush) is homeless due to @ukhomeoffice. My office got him a place in a homeless shelter. Now the shelter are asking him for proof of his immigration status. @ukhomeoffice 1 week late in sending it. @carolinenokes can you sort before he is out on the street?
This is the hostile environment @sajidjavid told you he was going to make more humane.. It is impossible to have a humane immigration policy alongside the hostile environment - that is a paradox. A government that cared about human rights would stop this deportation today. https://t.co/2C7h4vuCoo

With such a vast amount of wealth at their disposal I simply fail to see how it is tenable for Oxbridge colleges to continue to pay lip service to access and dedicate such a tiny proportion of their vast wealth to improving access - eg foundation years.  https://t.co/m1jPyHtfDt
Why are Oxbridge colleges not spending even a tiny bit of this wealth on foundation years to improve access for students from under-represented and disadvantaged backgrounds?  There can be no more excuses or passing the buck for their failings on access.  https://t.co/m1jPyHtfDt
If you are an Oxford graduate: when your college asks for ¬£ find out how many students from disadvantaged backgrounds they took &amp; what their plans are to increase this. Make donations contingent on resources going to foundation yrs or access projects in under-represented regions.
I never thought @FT would ask me to write a column about improving access to Oxford but they did. Money talks, so if Oxford will not change itself then it is time for alumni to vote with their cheque books next time they get asked for donations. https://t.co/qfMOcgmS6h via @FT

Er, you have made a mistake. The documents you have linked to in this article from UCAS say nothing about predicted grades, nor does the data that Oxford published yesterday.

I have written to Home Sec to demand that he immediately sets up a hardship fund for Windrush citizens who have been left destitute by the Home Office. It is yet another failure in a litany of abject failures that Windrush citizens are being left homeless &amp; hungry on the streets.
Windrush citizens can‚Äôt wait months for the Home Office to carry out a call for evidence and public consultation - they need to put food on the table and a roof over their heads tonight.
It cannot be the Home Office marking their own homework when it was the Home Office that caused this crisis and that is why I am calling for a public inquiry.
It was the Home Office that deported 63 British citizens. It was the Home Office that imprisoned British citizens, stripped them of their rights and pushed them into destitution, desperation and depression.
The Home Secretary should have made this statement in person to the House of Commons instead of publishing a written statement just before Parliament rises for recess.  I find the idea that an internal review can be considered sufficient absolutely ridiculous. https://t.co/23a2hCzw3o

How dare you talk to me in such a condescending manner. ‚ÄúI think he means‚Äù. I know full bloody well what I mean thank you very much. I mean what the EVIDENCE tells us.

Plus ca change, plus c‚Äôest la meme chose. Gordon made me his Higher Education Minister and I‚Äôm still here dragging Oxford https://t.co/K9OUuuuktT
And on the topic of ability vs institutional bias:  When we take into account how many kids in each region get straight A‚Äôs then a straight A student from London is twice as likely to get into Oxford as a straight A student from the North West and Yorkshire (30% vs 15%). Why?
Oxford try to say northern, working-class and black kids don't apply. Oxford colleges have ¬£billions in endowments. Go to their schools and tell them that they will come for free @UniofOxford. Christ Church college alone has an endowment of ¬£500m. This is not complicated stuff.
"It grants places to whoever gets the best grades. End of." Er, apart from the fact that if you apply from an independent school you are 33% more likely to be granted a place than from a state school. If you are white you are twice as likely to get a place than if you are black. https://t.co/AICniAxBCN
Hello @UniofOxford is it your official position that I am "bitter" just because I am prepared to criticise your institutional failings on access, FOI the data and publish it? This contradicts your press statements that say how determined you are to improve access. Which is right? https://t.co/K9pkojAdJv
Maybe it would help if every time @UniofOxford ring up alumni asking for donations, people refuse to donate any more ¬£ until their college makes progress on access. https://t.co/3jFIYfoM6j
@Serenaismusing Sorry I missed this I receive hundreds of tweets. Happy to speak with you, can you email media@davidlammy.co.uk? David
If your education was that good you would understand that your anecdotal experience does not outweigh the evidence that private school applicants are 33% more likely to get in and white students twice as likely to get in as black students.

Whatever Oxford is doing to try to encourage talented students in seaside towns and former industrial heartlands in the North, the Midlands and Wales to apply it is clearly not working.
Oxford is supposed to be a national university yet is abjectly failing to live up to this role and the Government must review whether it can continue to fund Oxford to the tune of hundreds of millions every year in taxpayers money.
If Oxford is serious about access the University needs to put its money where its mouth is and introduce a University-wide foundation year, get a lot better at encouraging talented students from under-represented backgrounds to apply and use contextual data when making offers.
The regional bias is shocking. When we take into account how many straight A students in each region, then a straight A student from London (30%) is twice as likely to get into @UniofOxford than a straight A student from the North West or Yorkshire (15%). Explain this bias?
For four of the biggest courses ‚Äì Law, PPE, Medicine, Geography ‚Äì you are twice as likely to get in if you are white compared to if you are BAME. Oxford need to address these institutional failings instead of spinning the figures and blaming the schools or applicants.
You are 5X as likely to get into @JesusOxfordJCR if you are white than if you are black. You are 4X as likely to get into @BalliolOxford if you are white than if you are black. Not a single Black student was admitted for Computer Science or Psychology in 3 years (30 applied).
You are 33% more likely to get into @UniofOxford applying from an independent school than from a state school. You are twice as likely to get into @magdalenoxford @StAnnesCollege @StJohnsOx if you are applying from an independent school than from a state school. Why is this?
You are twice as likely to get into @UniofOxford as a white applicant (24%) than a black applicant (12%). Why? 1/4 Oxford colleges did not admit a single black student in a whole year group at least once between 2015-17. 8 colleges less than 1% black. Why?
Eg: @MansfieldOxford 88% state school, @TrinityOxford 41% state school, @magdalenoxford 47%. Having admissions controlled by 30+ colleges prevents any real progress. Time to move towards centralised admissions process if @UniofOxford serious about access, otherwise it's all talk.
Eg: @wadhamoxford @MansfieldOxford @StHughsCollege taking double the number of students from areas with low progression to HE as a % of their intake compared to @TrinityOxford. How can @UniofOxford claim to care about access whilst putting up with this?
Eg: @MansfieldOxford @lmhoxford taking double the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds as a % of their intake compared to @ExeterCollegeOx @TrinityOxford. How is this acceptable? Systemic, real change impossible under college system. Centralised admissions required.
Huge differences between the individual colleges on admissions of state school students, BAME students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Some colleges are working hard to address this issue, many simply seem to not care. They are just recruiting their in own image.
The data I published last year showed that Grammar school applicants account for 1/4 all state school students, and that a student applying from a Grammar school is almost as likely to get a place as a student from a private, independent school. Grammar school =/= state comp.
A 1.4% increase in state school intake over a period of 5 years is glacial progress. It is so small that it could easily just be a blip. 1.4% is just 45 students per year. Oxford also include Grammar school students to boost the "state school" intake figures. This is ridiculous.
My response to Oxford University access data published today. (This thread will be long, and will include facts and figures).  Oxford is still a bastion of entrenched, wealthy, upper class, white, southern privilege. We need systemic change, not more spin and PR exercises.

The head of the Commonwealth Taskforce asked me for advice on their 'outreach strategy' because people are too scared to contact the Home Office.  My advice is simple - do not come to my surgery to tell people to come forward and then throw them in prison. https://t.co/XrUWhBafPF
Thanks for your support and solidarity Jeremy. Home Office caseworkers came to my constituency surgery last Friday to encourage him to come forward. He did so on Monday and instead of his citizenship &amp; passport he got thrown in prison. I visited him in HM Pentonville this morning https://t.co/G9owSqHtTM

This was at Lunar House Stephen. Absolutely shocking way to treat people who have been failed so gravely by the state. @carolinenokes you have to sort this out. How can the Home Office deny my constituents their citizenship for years, invite them to meeting &amp; then turn them away? https://t.co/qBSQ67NKsm
A group of Windrush citizens were turned away because of "building security policy" even though they had an appointment at 7pm. They have been told to return today and advised to "bring food" for the "long haul". This is an absolute shambles and a disgraceful way to treat people.
My constituent was invited to a Home Office  building for an appointment at 7pm to begin the process of getting their British citizenship. They turned up at 6pm. They were turned away even though they had an appointment. What is going on @carolinenokes? This is outrageous.
They can‚Äôt say they weren‚Äôt warned that it is impossible to leave the customs union without a hard border in Northern Ireland. Shame they have wasted 23 months on this nonsense.

Absolute shambles over Hackitt Review. First the Review doesn't recommend banning combustible materials on high-rise blocks. Then Dame Hackitt herself says she would support it. Now in Parliament Ministers say they're going to consult on doing it. Don't consult on it, do it now.
I simply cannot believe how, one year on from the Grenfell Tower fire, the Hackitt review doesn't recommend that combustible materials are banned and that desktop studies - where materials are approved WITHOUT A FIRE TEST INVOLVING AN ACTUAL FIRE are banned. A betrayal. https://t.co/dTwnaZyRXd
Hackitt has let Grenfell survivors and their families down. They needed a fearless review that would stand up to the industry lobbyists. A failure to ban combustible materials and desktop studies is a betrayal and a whitewash. https://t.co/9grnpcNbmj

and I find it unfathomable that this review has not recommended an outright ban on combustible material. (4)
in Grenfell with recommendations that ensure that an atrocity like Grenfell can never happen again. I simply fail to see how it is deemed appropriate for any combustible material to be used on any tower block in this country... (3)
I will continue to stand with the Grenfell families and will continue to call for an outright ban on any combustible materials. The Grenfell families and the public needed a review that was fearless in standing up to the industry on behalf of all those who lost their lives.. (2)

I have seen the proliferation of dozens of bookies on Tottenham High Rd and Green Lanes spreading like a virus funded by exorbitant profits from FOBTs. So many lives ruined and families torn apart. I make no apology for standing up to the gambling lobby and will continue to do so
A simple message to the bookies and gambling lobby on FOBTs today: if your entire business model is based on exploiting addiction and making vulnerable people destitute on machines that are fixed against them then it isn‚Äôt a business model, it is a model of vulture capitalism.

Citizens treated by the state as though they were criminals. That's a crime right there.   The Home Office was able to identify these 63 people because their own records showed that they lived in Britain &amp; were British citizens. They deported them anyway. https://t.co/N5ZE8MmVJd

Don't forget record numbers of people reliant on foodbanks JC. Over 1m reliant on foodbanks to survive in one of the richest countries in the world. isn't a "strong and stable" economy #PMQs
Another shocking performance by the PM. In office but not in power. The clue is in the name - @jeremycorbyn asks the questions and @theresa_may is supposed to answer. Unable to control her own Cabinet, unable to gain agreement so tries to avoid every question about customs union.
The last time we deported British citizens was to Australia in 1868. This was done on the quiet and in secret by the Home Office. This cannot be swept under the carpet. We need an independent public inquiry into how and why the state rounded up and deported its own citizens.
Given the Home Office‚Äôs record of wrongfully deporting, imprisoning and stripping British citizens of their rights the Home Office cannot be trusted to mark it‚Äôs own homework. We need a proper public inquiry to establish the facts of how 63 British citizens were deported.
1 deportation of a British citizen would warrant a public inquiry and 63 definitely requires a public inquiry. Misleading statements by Ministers and total chaos at the Home Office means we need an independent public inquiry to establish the facts and get to the bottom of this. https://t.co/neMZ9cG8VH
If 1 person was wrongfully deported that would merit a public inquiry. For 63 people to be deported is unthinkable and unconscionable. https://t.co/UmbylCxy6N
63 British nationals have been rounded up and sent across the ocean to the Caribbean. The Home Secretary said yesterday that this number could rise. Just because these people are working class and black it does not mean their lives do not matter &amp; do not merit a public inquiry.
Sending British citizens to the Caribbean without a pound in their pocket means that many will now be dead or destitute. They have been deported from a country with the NHS, our welfare state, their family and friends. Of course we need a Public Inquiry into how this happened.
I will be on @BBCr4today at 08:30 talking about our the news that government wrongfully deporting 63+ British citizens. This has to mark the end of the hostile environment and we need a public inquiry into how this was able to happen. The Home Office is clearly unfit for purpose.
Shocking. Bonuses based on deporting British citizens and yet more evidence Govnt have been misleading Parliament https://t.co/ssCVJvVuP5
We need a public inquiry into how this was able to happen, who know what and when they knew about it. This is an egregious injustice carried out by the state against its own citizens. The worst home affairs or human rights crisis in my political lifetime.  https://t.co/qIaxYqxFYO
Still no answers on numbers of citizens imprisoned in their own country, denied right to work, denied access to benefits/healthcare, refused right to return to UK after going overseas and ‚Äòvoluntarily‚Äô left when threatened with deportation. I will not let them get away with it.
Pleased that after many years campaigning 50% of the St Ann's hospital site will be genuinely affordable housing @StARTharingey. I opposed council's plans for 14% affordable housing.

The Home Secretary tells Home Affairs Select Committee as many as 63 Windrush generation may have been wrongly deported. This is the worst human rights and home affairs crisis in my time in politics. The Prime Minister's hostile environment stands in the dock, guilty as charged.
The Prime Minister needs to come to Parliament and explain how 63 British citizens were wrongfully deported on her watch. Truly a day of national shame.
Delighted that my constituent's citizenship application has been approved and he will be invited to a citizenship ceremony in the next few weeks. Justice at last and lots more work to do.

The Govt has lost sight of who the Grenfell Inquiry is for. It is for the people who were failed before the fire &amp; have been failed since the fire.

It is totally impossible to have a "fair and humane" immigration policy whilst also pursuing the hostile environment that treats everyone who looks like they could be an immigrant like a criminal.

His indefinite Leave to Remain was granted 22 Dec 1998. Why was he arrested and imprisoned? Why does the Home Office presume people are guilty until proven innocent? I hope Immigration Minister will apologise personally to my constituent instead of "The Home Office apologises".

Have there been cases of wrongful deportation? The Immigration Minister said she doesn't know. There have been, and it is her job to know. Rank incompetence of the Home Office skewered by @SDoughtyMP at the Home Affairs Select Committee yesterday. https://t.co/7VnUybq95B
That was a dismal performance by the PM. @jeremycorbyn ran rings around her with simple Qs she could not answer. Customs issue tearing the Cabinet apart and every option put forward by the Govnt has already been rejected by EU. Absolute shambles putting our economy at risk. #PMQs
PM says ‚Äòfurther work‚Äô needed on the Govnt‚Äôs position on customs union. You‚Äôve had 23 months, what on earth have you been doing? Negotiations are an absolute shambles, Foreign Secretary mouthing off all over the place, Cabinet Ministers can‚Äôt even agree amongst themselves. #PMQs
End the inhumane practice of deportation flights now. The descendants of slaves are being shackled and chained, dragged on to deportation flights and sent back across the same ocean that Britain took their ancestors from in slave ships centuries ago. https://t.co/OknNFbXkCp
Read this exchange from Home Affairs Select Committee yesterday and then pick your jaw up off the floor.

The Commonwealth are watching this debate. And they are watching Tory MPs hectoring, filibustering, obfuscating, conflating the Windrush citizens with illegal immigrants and most of all making it look very much like the Conservative Government does not take this issue seriously.
Stop the clock. A Tory MP intervened on @HackneyAbbott to talk about illegal immigration after about 3 minutes. The Windrush generation are not illegal immigrants. They are citizens. It is deeply offensive to conflate them with illegal immigrants. They should have some respect.
Today no doubt Tory MPs and Ministers will conflate Windrush with illegal immigration. The evidence shows that from 2013-17 the Home Office imprisoned 75,000 who were subsequently released. The hostile environment means that our government imprisons thousands of innocent people. https://t.co/Dv1WHM1Z1j

Don't let Amber Rudd's resignation distract from a toxic hostile environment policy that needs to be scrapped. Resignations aim to draw a line and move on. The Windrush generation will not get justice until the law is changed, not just the home secretary. https://t.co/TvaDsLbHMp

@AngelaRayner @HackneyAbbott Thank you Angela. As you it is about justice, and I won't be going quiet now.
The resignation of the Home Secretary must not detract from the fact that this crisis was a direct result of the hostile environment policy. That policy must now be reviewed, and the Home Office must move quickly to compensate and grant citizenship to the Windush generation. (3)
Amber Rudd resigned because she didn't know what was going on in her own department and she had clearly lost the confidence of her own civil servants. The real issue is the hostile environment policy that caused this crisis in the first place. (2)
Response to Amber Rudd's resignation as Home Secretary:  The campaign for justice on behalf of the Windrush generation is not just about political scalps. At its heart this crisis is about a system that was allowed to dehumanise and victimise Windrush British citizens. (1)

Thread from earlier outlining why I am pressing Ministers to turn their warm words into legislation. Windrush citizens understandably don‚Äôt trust the Home Office. To mean anything, the promises made by Ministers need to become rights that are enshrined in and protected by the law https://t.co/3nFCN41tHn
The Govnt needs to act to guarantee the rights of Windrush citizens in legislation. There is huge insecurity and people are worried that if they came forward they are going to be imprisoned. There is no legal basis for the promises that have been made. We urgently need clarity. https://t.co/92rZaWrRqR
Amber Rudd was apparently not aware of deportation targets.  "Did you discuss any of this with Amber Rudd?"  "Yes I did talk to the Home Secretary about that."  Please stop taking us for fools.

He knew that Paulette Wilson, a Windrush generation citizen who previously worked in Parliament, was detained in October 2017. https://t.co/hkIBGUhkIJ
"Windrush citizens are not 'applying' for anything - they have the right to citizenship". The Home Office should not treat Windrush citizens as applicants required to meet a certain threshold - this process should seek to confirm applicants' status/rights. https://t.co/h9ZAiGI0Ec
Is anyone really surprised that the Windrush Generation don‚Äôt trust the Home Office when this is going on? This is why I am calling for legislation to protect and uphold their rights. Warm words from Ministers are not enough. We need legislative guarantees https://t.co/9E73uw0Wu4
@SDoughtyMP Thank you Stephen
@helenhayes_ Thank you Helen
@lucianaberger Thanks for your support Luciana
@heidi_mp Thank you Heidi.
@MikeGapes Thank you Mike.
Warm words don‚Äôt cut it ‚Äì Windrush children's rights must be enshrined and protected in law. We need details about the compensation package, clarification of the evidence that the Home Office is now demanding and guarantees that no Windrush children will face enforcement action.
I am helping my constituents to get legal advice before they speak to the Home Office, and the statements made by the Home Secretary and Prime Minister need to be written into law before they actually mean anything. (9) https://t.co/Vbo5X0KKxR
The Home Office still can‚Äôt tell us how many Windrush citizens have been deported, detained and stripped of their rights. Frankly, why should the Windrush children believe what the Home Office says about this new taskforce? We need legislative change. (8) https://t.co/Vbo5X0KKxR
Government ministers cannot simply make up immigration policy as they go along. The Home Office is in absolute chaos and the Windrush children simply don‚Äôt trust Home Office officials. After all that they have been put through nobody can blame them. (7) https://t.co/Vbo5X0KKxR
Home Secretary has said there will be no immigration enforcement action against Windrush children. This promise cannot be kept without further clarification and changes in legislation/immigration rules. A statement does not and cannot rewrite the law. (6) https://t.co/Vbo5X0KKxR
What is the 'burden of proof'? What is meant by a ‚Äújudgement based on all the circumstances of the cases and on the balance of probabilities"? Will there be legal aid? Windrush children need written guidance so they can come forward with confidence. (5) https://t.co/Vbo5X0KKxR
Taskforce: Windrush citizens are not ‚Äòapplying‚Äô for anything ‚Äì they have the right to citizenship. Home Office should not treat Windrush citizens as applicants required to meet a certain threshold ‚Äì this process should aim to confirm applicants‚Äô status (4) https://t.co/Vbo5X0KKxR
Compensation: How will Govnt compensate for trauma, pain and suffering caused in addition to lost jobs, benefits, legal fees, healthcare etc? What about family members who have been unable to see loved ones before they died, attend funerals, etc? (3) https://t.co/Vbo5X0KKxR
I am calling for legal guarantees in three areas: compensation, burden of proof required by the Home Office Commonwealth taskforce assessing cases and promises about immigration enforcement. Immigration policy made up on the hoof risks further problems (2) https://t.co/Vbo5X0KKxR
Thread: I have written to the PM supported by 200 MPs demanding that the promises made by the Govnt following the Windrush crisis are written into law. Warm words don't cut it. Announcements by Ministers with no legal backing are simply not good enough (1) https://t.co/Vbo5X0KKxR
‚ÄúUntil two weeks ago we honestly thought this affected about ten people,‚Äô one adviser told me.‚Äù  I have had more than 10 affected people from Tottenham contact me in the last 5 days alone. How did the Home Office get this so badly wrong? Shocking.  https://t.co/boSR6VQ1Re

This is really wonderful news. I‚Äôm so happy Sylvester now feels able to go by his own name and is no longer in hiding in his own country.

Was it in your ministerial Red Box? Did you sign it off without reading it? If not does your office sign off documents regarding deportation without you reading them?

To be totally honest with you, I would have preferred work to ensure that our immigration policy is fair and humane a while ago.

If I was Home Secretary I'd have resigned over the Windrush scandal itself, resigned a second time for misleading Parliament about the existence of deportation targets, and then resigned a third time for misleading Parliament about not knowing. A disgrace. https://t.co/l0jX8dmtSu
Windrush crisis: 2 new cases this morning so 13 in Tottenham alone since Tuesday. Including one man who has been without any status at all since 1976 despite being born a British citizen. A tragedy, an injustice and a disgrace. 42 years a stranger in his own country @ukhomeoffice
In Cambridge this morning to meet @Cambridge_Uni Vice Chancellor to discuss access and widening participation. An added bonus of bumping into @DanielZeichner at the train station

I‚Äôm sick and tired of Govnt trying to defend Windrush scandal by creating straw man about illegal immigrants and conflating separate issues. Who is talking about illegal immigrants? I‚Äôm talking about British citizens. Absolutely nothing to do with policy on illegal immigrants. https://t.co/wX9KbQcGey
That‚Äôs not the issue? Nobody has ever said that is the issue? The issue is trying to deport British citizens, detaining them and stripping them of their rights. Two totally separate issues, very easy to understand. https://t.co/Ykkg9F8Pps

In response to my question today @AmberRuddHR says Windrush crisis has come as "some element of surprise".... I raised a case in 2011, the Home Office knew about this in 2014 and it has been in the media for months. She is the Home Secretary. Surprised? https://t.co/7xJZxG9aSg
10 days after I first asked, the Home Secretary still can't tell me how many Windrush citizens have been detained or deported. She still can't tell me. Yesterday the Home Secretary misled Parliament at @CommonsHomeAffs. Is she really the right person to lead the Home Office? https://t.co/7xJZxG9aSg
As I said two days ago: I have been a government minister. If I had been responsible for the Windrush scandal I certainly would have resigned I would have been so embarrassed and ashamed. And now it turns out the Home Secretary lied to Parliament yesterday https://t.co/jyYJPWEYup
The Home Office has imprisoned innocent citizens in their own country and stripped them of their rights for years. Then the Home Secretary either lied to Parliament yesterday about the existence of removal targets, or has absolutely no idea what is going on in her Department. https://t.co/SzfOK21al5
It is now clear that a) targets meant innocent Windrush citizens were targeted as ‚Äòeasy targets‚Äô, b) the Home Secretary lied to Parliament @CommonsHomeAffs and c) has completely lost control of her department. If I was responsible for this disgrace I would have resigned last week https://t.co/QSov6r9kck

It's a good job my office keeps better records than @ukhomeoffice. I raised a Windrush case with the Immigration Minister in 2011. I am demanding personal apology from the Prime Minister, significant compensation for William &amp; urgent confirmation of his citizenship and passport. https://t.co/JjzbX7ICzJ
I raised a Windrush case with the Home Office 7 yrs ago. William arrived aged 4 in 1950's and worked for 40 years. He still has not got his citizenship, passport or right to work. The Immigration Minister told me my constituent's problem was his own fault. https://t.co/mVTsPeMW4V
At PMQS Theresa May said: "We owe it to them (the Windrush generation) and the British people." This is the point the Govt just don't understand. The Windrush children ARE British people. They ARE British citizens. They came here as citizens. That is why this is such an injustice
My friend and comrade @YvetteCooperMP absolutely knocked this out of the park today at #PMQs. What has changed since 2004 @theresa_may? "I‚Äôm actually sick and tired of Government Ministers who simply blame other people when something goes wrong". https://t.co/zv2Dlx6Q8B
Clarification urgently required following my questions at PMQs @theresa_may @AmberRuddHR @carolinenokes https://t.co/boYKlB5QSH
In #PMQs I raised a Windrush case that I first wrote to the Home Office about in 2011. My constituent came here in 1956 and worked for 40 years before being stripped of his right to work. 7 yrs on his case has still not been resolved. I will be fighting for compensation for him. https://t.co/ReumEsQPT2
So far they've tried to blame Home Office officials, immigration enforcement staff, Labour ministers, successive governments and (in letters to me) the fact that Windrush children didn't get their status sorted before 1971 (they didn't need to - they were citizens). Any more? https://t.co/18XiumFGca
I want this assurance in writing. https://t.co/sOZlIhBf2H
Not good enough. https://t.co/KZR42OO0r2
Correct. How can the PM apparently take responsibility, apologise and promise action to address this crisis in one breath and then say ‚Äúit‚Äôs your fault‚Äù? The latter certainly makes the latter sound somewhat insincere to Windrush children still seeking justice and redress. #PMQs https://t.co/RvSPwdS19R
In what other field of public policy does the government increase fees by 200% and charge extortionate amounts making thousands and thousands of ¬£ in profit from people that the government itself bans from working or accessing benefits so they can earn money to pay these fees? https://t.co/BUgRvjUuZS

Here is the relevant section of the 1948 British Nationality Act. The Windrush Generation were British citizens when they were invited here. Their citizenship is theirs by right. It is not a gift that your government is benevolently granting them. They are reclaiming their rights https://t.co/8BaTKqDFGn
The burden of proof should not be on the Windrush children to jump through the Home Office‚Äôs hoops. They should immediately be granted the rights that are rightfully theirs under the 1948 British Nationality Act and remove any anxiety and uncertainty. https://t.co/Jk18N7OX8l
What exactly is the burden of proof the Home Office is now demanding?  What happens if an individual does not meet this threshold? Are their details going to be passed to immigration enforcement so they can be detained or deported? https://t.co/Jk18N7OX8l
Windrush children have feared detention and deportation if they raise their cases with the Home Office. They need a guarantee that this helpline will not be used as an information-gathering service for immigration enforcement.  https://t.co/6jr1DGI0Wy
"Should be considered British"? Are British.   The Windrush Generation (including my parents) were British citizens when they were invited here. See the 1948 British Nationality Act, Chapter 56, Part I.   Their British citizenship is and always has been theirs by right. https://t.co/Nze4MMSkBC

The Home Secretary announced that the Windrush taskforce will cover all Commonwealth nationals arriving up to 1988. I will be asking the Home Secretary to grant my constituent's citizenship today. (5)
What makes this all the more difficult is that my constituent is vulnerable and has learning difficulties. He has been fighting this alone with no resources and no support. Why did it take his MP intervening to get this sorted? Totally unjust and deeply wrong. (4)
His housing benefit was stopped on the basis of the Home Office saying he was here illegally. He had no right to work. This was only rectified once I spoke to the Home Office. He arrived from Nigeria in 1988. I will be asking the Home Office to grant his citizenship today. (3)
As a result, he was arrested by 9 immigration enforcement officials at home and detained in a detention centre under the suspicion of being an illegal immigrant. His application for citizenship was denied due to the Home Office losing his documents. (2)
Whilst we're on the topic of @ukhomeoffice injustices: My constituent who came from a Commonwealth country and has been living in Tottenham over 30 years was granted Indefinite Leave to Remain in 1998. The Home Office lost all their records of this Indefinite Leave to Remain. (1)
Working class students face poverty at college and university. This is why I fought to stop cuts to funding for apprenticeships for 16-18 yr old from disadvantaged background and why I am so proud to support @CollegeNELondon and the work they do. https://t.co/Cp6Cmlfix7
I have heard from 6 constituents already this morning with Windrush cases and it is not even lunchtime. Each individual case is a shocking indictment of this government and heartbreakingly sad. The scale of this crisis is unfathomable.
Home Secretary @AmberRuddHR Immigration Minister @carolinenokes you must sort this today. Why is my constituent being treated like an illegal immigrant despite providing documentation from 1964? This is an outrageous miscarriage of justice. Grant him his citizenship and passport.
I am disgusted and appalled by the case I have just received. My constituent arrived from Jamaica in 1964 aged 6. He has shown me his letter from the Home Office telling him that he will be deported despite having a National Insurance card from 1974 &amp; NHS documentation from 1964. https://t.co/ZnivtkhXwp

In Parliament tonight for debate on Office for Students debacle supporting @AngelaRayner @GordonMarsden @wesstreeting. Why is Govnt scrapping the position of Director of Fair Access and OFFA? What message does this send out about access about access and widening participation?
The Home Secretary also tried to blame the ‚Äústate‚Äù. The Government sets the policies of the government and Ministers are responsible for the actions of their department. That‚Äôs how it used to work when I was a Minister, anyway. https://t.co/yG8g0LU7sI
It has brought great shame on our nation that the Windrush generation have had to go cap in hand to the Home Office to try to secure the rights that are theirs in the first place. I will continue to fight for justice and compensation on their behalf. https://t.co/etSxzxP7Yj
The #Windrush generation and their children were citizens when we invited them here 70 years ago. Their citizenship is theirs by right and it should never have been taken away. I am proud to have fought to right this historic wrong. I will never stop fighting for justice. https://t.co/HlHmKgJtfl
Home Secretary set a cut off date of 1973. Many Caribbean countries still had not been granted independence at that stage: Grenada (1974), Dominica (1978), St. Lucia (1979), St. Vincent (1979), Antigua &amp; Barbuda (1981), St. Kitts &amp; Nevis (1983). What about them? #Windrush
Find it perverse that even after the last week the Home Secretary just referred to Windrush children as "customers" who are being instructed to call a "customer helpline". They are not taking back unwanted gifts, they are trying to guarantee the rights that are rightfully theirs.
Home Secretary just said Windrush children can become citizens if they want to be. They were citizens when we invited them 70 years ago. Their citizenship is theirs by right, and was taken away by your government, not something that your government is now choosing to grant them.
And yes, anonymous hate mail writer, I will be in the House of Commons at 4pm continuing to campaign for justice on behalf of the Windrush generation and their children. I sit at the back of the chamber, and you can watch here: https://t.co/CHKHbHGXEm
It would be a shocking response to the Windrush crisis if the government was to respond to these shocking miscarriages of justice by making the Home Office even less transparent and accountable to the people our immigration system purports to serve. https://t.co/W1ZffVdYa0
And let me be clear, following the 1948 Nationality Act my parents and the Windrush Generation were invited here as British citizens. Learn your history. Citizens have been retrospectively renamed as ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù as a result of legislation &amp; policy pandering to far-right rhetoric
I have just received a letter telling me to be ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù as a black man for all ‚Äúwe have done for those black people who came to live here‚Äù or ‚Äúgo back to where ever you came from‚Äù. I was born in the Whittington Hospital the son of Windrush migrants. And I will speak for them. https://t.co/WkCeDpLQPf
@JenWilliamsMEN Yes, so many families affected. Cc: @KarenPBuckMP And also regulations and how effectively they are upheld or not. Govnt have not been forthcoming with info when I have asked PQs about regulations and holding landlords to account for the conditions in state or private temp accom.

Govnt Ministers when speaking in public: We apologise and will do whatever it takes to resolve these problems.  Govnt whip when speaking in private in private: Windrush crisis is nothing to do with immigration policy, just Labour hypocrisy and opportunism. https://t.co/9ZeTehqjLu
Tory Government whip says Windrush crisis is "nothing to do with" immigration policy and the hostile environment &amp; and our response campaigning for justice is "the height of opportunism and hypocrisy". Is this the official position @theresa_may? Hope not. https://t.co/8xOQaPzCl2
As hundreds of horrendous cases come to light I find it difficult to understand how a government whip can accuse the opposition and Labour MPs campaigning for justice of opportunism and hypocrisy. Very different indeed to the conciliatory lines of apology Ministers have put out. https://t.co/Y9SXxvasSl
Last week‚Äôs ‚Äúunintended consequence‚Äù defence now lies in tatters.

Adrian contacted me this week.

In October 2013 @theresa_may proudly boasted that she would "deport first and hear appeals later". I opposed her then and I oppose her now. Theresa May must take responsibility for the Windrush crisis. It is because of her race to the bottom pandering to anti-immigrant sentiment. https://t.co/xExpXKnLJI
Emails coming in constantly with horrendous stories from Windrush Children. Threats of deportation, people refused re-entry after a holiday and unable to return home, people unable to attend their parents' funerals. Absolutely appalling. I am raising each case with Home Office.
The Prime Minister told us that Albert Thompson would be receiving the treatment he needs. That is news to Albert. Maybe the Prime Minister and Home Secretary should meet him to apologise? https://t.co/H9YtZcAhey
Jay contacted me this week and I am proud that he has bravely told his story. He was born and raised here &amp; has been forced by our govnt to become a stateless citizen because his mother is a Windrush child. He deserves justice, an apology and reparations.  https://t.co/GGKFk35dkx
Correct. Take responsibility @theresa_may. You reap what you sow. We need an independent review of the pernicious, cruel and inhumane hostile environment. https://t.co/ES0uAeMvIc

Today marks 50 years since Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech. It is a national disgrace that the government has not learnt from our history and in 2018 innocent black people are being imprisoned in their own country and stripped of their rights. https://t.co/gxqoSErU3o
Windrush: We urgently need to hear from the Prime Minister about compensation and reparations.

Well said @HackneyAbbott four yrs ago asking Theresa May about the implications of her 2014 Immigration Act. Theresa May's chickens have come to roost with regards to her anti-immigrant rhetoric, hostile environment policies and pandering to the far-right https://t.co/KXYUGwJhh4
This is just a lie. At least two impact assessments by Home Office officials warned of this. 2014: "Some non-UK born older people may have additional difficulties in providing original documentation... Some may have had their immigration records destroyed‚Äù https://t.co/AYQqdK7SxQ https://t.co/y3pWqTQkhm
Four committee rooms packed to the rafters last night protesting the Windrush injustice. As Caribbean people enslaved, colonised and invited to Britain as citizens we remember our history. We don't just want an apology, we want reparations and compensation https://t.co/cOY77UgWhz
Narrator: Actually, ‚Äúfar from objecting to the plan, May‚Äôs only objection at that point was that it might look too soft on illegal immigrants.‚Äù Happy to jog your memory you can read your emails saying the Home Secretary knew of and didn‚Äôt oppose vans here: https://t.co/HBiasTSoot https://t.co/sqAvFtyb7H
Turns out the only problem Theresa May had with the go home vans was that they were too soft.. https://t.co/HBiasTSoot
Justice delayed too long is justice denied. It is my honour and privilege to have spoken to hundreds of my brothers and sisters tonight in Parliament. Committee rooms and corridors packed to rafters.

Oh and Beverley Hughes - the Labour Home Office Minister who Theresa May accused of losing control of the Home Office and failing to take responsibility? She resigned. The Prime Minister should ensure that her Home Office Ministers follow her advice. https://t.co/VWvbIJbIzm
In 2004 Theresa May said "I find it extraordinary that a Minister isn‚Äôt willing just to step up to the plate and take responsibility... I‚Äôm actually sick and tired of Government Ministers who simply blame other people when something goes wrong".  I agree.  https://t.co/zv2Dlx6Q8B

Theresa May talking about her Immigration Bill in Parliament on 22 October 2013: She said that the Bill will enable to Government to "deport first and hear appeals later". That's the reality of the hostile environment.  https://t.co/qLEHFvaIby https://t.co/OqbbZAsrRq
By the way, when we were in govnt Immigration Minister Beverley Hughes resigned over this in 2004. For the Windrush scandal, imprisoning innocent people, stripping them of their rights and not even knowing if you deported them? No resignations. Go figure. https://t.co/BCa9R4zwXW

Nick Timothy is claiming the Home Secretary was opposed to the Home Office sending 'go home' vans round constituencies with large ethnic minority populations. This answer to @TulipSiddiq from 2016 confirms May knew about the vans - so why didn't he stop them if she was opposed? https://t.co/AAKJMftAWI
5 yrs ago I wrote an open letter to @theresa_may opposing her 'Go Home' vans as a threat to the cohesion and integrity of our society targeting areas with ethnic minority populations. Aggressive hostile environment policies were wrong then &amp; are wrong now. https://t.co/CbMCzU3qhq
Nick how can something happen when the Home Secretary is opposed to the specific thing that the Home Office is doing? Where is the evidence of this? If TM was opposed to go home vans when she was Home Secretary how and why did they happen? She was in charge of the department! https://t.co/hQFc8UKwA1
The go home vans were an aberration. I also want to know who signed off on the decision to send immigration enforcement officials to a church in Tottenham where destitute asylum seekers and refugees who are barred from working and have no recourse to public funds eat. https://t.co/KY69f09E5D

Home Office assessment from 2014 explicitly warned about impact of draconian hostile environment policies: "Some may have had their immigration records destroyed. Some will have originally come into the country under old legislation but may have difficulty in evidencing this" https://t.co/NFC2JYQwWG
The image of black men and women being deported on a mass scale shackled in wrist-to-wrist restraints on a chartered plane is not something we should accept. Why do we deport first, appeal later? Read this about deportation flights to Jamaica. https://t.co/De4F3Bjp80
Lessons must be learnt from the Windrush crisis and a review is now a vital step in understanding how and why our immigration system treats people in this way and what reforms are needed to prevent any further cruelty and injustices.
In light of this crisis and the devastating impact it has had on huge numbers of innocent people I am calling on the Prime Minister to establish an independent review of immigration policy and the hostile environment.
I have urged the PM to take responsibility and acknowledge that this crisis is a direct result of the hostile environment policy that she implemented at the Home Office ‚Äì particularly the changes brought in by the 2014 Immigration Act when she was Home Secretary.
10) Will the PM make exemptions TODAY for these Windrush children and guarantee their status today instead of placing the burden of proof on these individuals to prove their status? The PM can and must step in to end this crisis and guarantee their status today
9) Will this compensation be applied retrospectively to all of those Windrush children who have a) spent money on legal fees and legal advice b) documentation fees c) lost their jobs d) been denied access to benefits and public services and e) incurred other fees?
8) How much money will be set aside to compensate each of the Windrush children affected by this crisis, when will it be made available and how will it be distributed?
7) Why is government still asking Windrush children to provide documentation to prove their immigration status when the Home Office itself destroyed these documents?
6) Will the now issue a full and unreserved public apology for the way in which Windrush children have been treated and personally apologise to each individual who has been affected? This is urgently needed to rebuild relations with our allies &amp; Caribbean diaspora in this country
5) How many Windrush children have been imprisoned in immigration detention centres in their own country, for how long and for what reason?
4) How many Windrush children have been deported or threatened with deportation? It is her government doing this on her watch, she must know the numbers and publish this information immediately.
3) PM's letter to me confirmed that Windrush children have a right to access public services. For what reason have they been denied healthcare, denied access to benefits, lost their jobs?
2) PM's letter to me yesterday confirmed that Windrush children are not and have never been "outside the law". So for what reason has her government treated them as outside the law and criminals in their own country?
1) PM has herself acknowledged in her letter to me yesterday that the Windrush children are entitled to be here. So for what reason has her government harassed them, stripped them of their rights, threatened them with deportation or deported them?
Thread: This morning I have written to the Prime Minister setting out 10 urgent questions the government must answer about the Windrush crisis. I am also calling for an independent review of the government's immigration policy and the hostile environment that caused this crisis. https://t.co/iA6d3Gaybb
Theresa May's hostile environment means that immigration enforcement officials turn up unannounced and unwelcome to a church in Tottenham that offers food and support to refugees who are not allowed to work and are destitute because they have no recourse to public funds #Windrush
Theresa May's hostile environment turned teachers, doctors and charities into border guards, co-opted every arm of the state and voluntary organisations into a punitive immigration regime and treated human beings like numbers. Now her chickens are coming home to roost. #Windrush
Government in chaos over Windrush after double setback for May - PM‚Äôs claim about destruction of landing cards and assurances over Albert Thompson‚Äôs treatment called into question. She should guarantee Windrush children‚Äôs status today. No delays or excuses https://t.co/JWRJykVatJ
All credit to @ameliagentleman for outstanding public service journalism telling the stories of the voiceless. The case of Dexter Bristol is a scandal and an outrage. His death is yet another shameful episode. A litany of abject failures by the government. https://t.co/ZYxF1wtb9d
In 2012 the PM boasted to journalists about her hostile environment. In 2018 innocent people are threatened with deportation, stripped of their rights and treated like criminals by the Home Office. If you lie down with dogs then you will get fleas. https://t.co/3OxfCq0wuJ
What a total shambles this government is. A sorry, tawdry state of affairs getting worse every day. https://t.co/gOF8O8Dei0
Not a good look from the PM. A huge scandal affecting thousands that is a direct result of her policies as Home Secretary. Instead of taking responsibility she misleads Parliament and tries to shift the blame. It is hard to take her apology seriously.  https://t.co/MOHW86nq7x
This just gets worse and worse. Heart-breaking story after heart-breaking story. Rest in Peace Dexter Bristol. What happened to you shames our nation, shames our Prime Minister and shames our Home Secretary. Home Office even cashed the ¬£10 cheque. https://t.co/rqdh5tIbso
Ministers who mislead the House should resign. Home Secretaries who lose control of the Home Office should resign.

Home Office need to clear this up by publishing evidence of who made this decision and when, given PM's accusation at PMQs that this was linked to Labour. They have changed their story so many times. https://t.co/YDx4BMS1WW
So in the space of a day the government say that they destroyed the documents because of data protection, then they said it was the border force‚Äôs decision, now they say it was Labour? Make your mind up
In PMQs hoping to get called. The PM can end this crisis today. Unilaterally declare exemptions for all Windrush children. Change the burden of proof and guarantee their status today. You can end this today Prime Minister.
Thank you so much to everyone writing to me with stories and photos. Human stories show why this matters. And the photos serve as a timeless reminder of our ancestors on whose shoulders we stand and whose behalf we speak out. This is a fight that we will win. #Windrush https://t.co/5HB8yT0ESZ
- How much money will be set aside to compensate each of those Windrush Children affected? - Will this compensation be retrospective and will it be applicable to all of those who have spent money on lawyers, lost their jobs, lost their homes, lost their benefits? If not, why not?
- Can the Prime Minister tell us how many Windrush children have been imprisoned in their own country? - How many denied access to benefits, healthcare, housing &amp; public services? - How many Windrush landing cards were destroyed by the Home Office when the PM weas Home Secretary?
- Will the Prime Minister now apologise to each individual who has been affected?  - Will the PM now make a public and unreserved apology for the way in which the Windrush Children have been treated? - How many Windrush Children have been deported or threatened with deportation?
- For what reason have Windrush Children been treating "outside the law" by your Government? - For what reason have Windrush Children been threatened with deportation, stripped of their rights and denied access to public services they have paid taxes for and indeed worked in?
"It is not a question of granting them an amnesty - as that would imply that they were previously outside the law - but of enabling them to secure documentation which attests to their status".

Home Office says they were destroyed to "comply with data protection laws, which required that such records were ‚Äúnot kept for longer than is necessary‚Äù. I've got news for you. They are required to stop you deporting &amp; detaining innocent people. For shame. What a disgrace this is
The truth: There but for the grace of God go I. My parents were part of the Windrush Generation. I am a child of the Windrush. This could have been me. I am doing this for my parents' generation and thousands who are suffering because of the Home Office https://t.co/gxqoSErU3o
Pleased that @carolinenokes confirmed this case being reviewed. This man spoke to @mrjamesob earlier about caring for his mother with cancer. "I've been living in the hostile environment. It's the only world I know". This is happening in Britain in 2018. https://t.co/cM7bZfy1ke

James is right. This is not a flaw this is not an accident this is not bureaucratic error.

If you lay down with dogs then you get the fleas https://t.co/YX1g4t2Y5M
I have also asked @AmberRuddHR how much money has been set aside to compensate Windrush Generation children for legal costs and other fees incurred in proving their immigration status and if this compensation be available retrospectively for those who have already paid such fees.
I have also asked @AmberRuddHR and @ukhomeoffice to review every single cases involving a Windrush Generation child to ensure that nobody has been wrongfully deported or detained. #WindrushJustice
Just asked @AmberRuddHR how many Windrush children have been  - Deported - Imprisoned in their own country - Denied access to benefits, healthcare, housing and public servicess - And how many Windrush landing cards destroyed by @ukhomeoffice  Will post answers when I get them
And let us not forget, it was the 2014 Immigration Act that removed legal protections for the Windrush Generation that protected long-term residents from deportation https://t.co/ABpb7AIxLd
The 2014 Immigration Act was at the very heart of @theresa_may hostile environment policy. In October 2013 @jeremycorbyn @HackneyAbbott @johnmcdonnellMP and I voted against it. #Windrush crisis shows who was on the right side of history and it isn't the PM https://t.co/6QwymDS1VI
In Immigration Bill debate October 2013 I said: "When my father arrived in this country it was typical to see "No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs" signs. We forget that at our peril.

It is an absolute disgrace that the Home Office has destroyed these documents and then forced Windrush-generation migrants to try and prove their status, threatening them with deportation and stripping them of their rights. Shame on you all. #Windrush https://t.co/ccIFryoLXB
The Windrush crisis is not one-off bureaucratic errors, it is in reality a direct result of systemic incompetence, callousness and cruelty within our immigration system. Heads must roll at the top of the Home Office over this scandal. A national disgrace. https://t.co/ccIFryoLXB
Home Office must declare immediate amnesty. Amnesty is the word used but it would not be an amnesty because these people have done nothing wrong. The Home Office destroyed their documents and is now accusing them of being here illegally. Those at top of Home Office need to go.
Home Office must immediately declare all Windrush Generation children are here legally. The Home Office destroyed documents proving when Windrush Genration arrived and now they are asking them to prove their status. Heads must roll at top of Home Office. https://t.co/ccIFryoLXB

Ms Ruth Williams, 75 years old Windrush citizen and mother of a son facing deportation: I am unwell and almost 75, I live on my own and I need my son to stay here. I need my family around me and I can‚Äôt face being alone. He has apple Home Office and been refused twice.
Ms Ruth Williams, 75 years old Windrush citizen and mother of a son facing deportation: I feel betrayed and a second class citizen in my own country. This makes me so sad and the Home Office must show some compassion.
This is a national disgrace. What is going makes me ashamed of our great country. The PM must act urgently to halt this deportation and all other Windrush deportations. Heads must roll over this and the Home Secretary and Immigration Minister must consider their positions

Some historical context on #Windrush crisis. 1948 Nationality Act meant that Caribbean migrants were invited to this country as citizens, including my parents. 1962 Immigration Act changes everything - citizens become ‚Äúimmigrants‚Äù. Fast forward to today and it all makes sense. https://t.co/1zHrUDAZyg
‚ÄúThe system worked‚Äù? No policy change.

Hard to believe this document was written and published. The fact that the Govnt feels this is an appropriate way to treat the ancestors of those Caribbean pioneers who were invited to Britain as citizens tells its own sad story about the treatment of immigrants in our country.
This document harks back to ‚Äúrepatriation‚Äù campaigns. This document was published when Theresa May was Home Sec, promoting her hostile environments policy ‚Äì the starting point for the injustices that we are seeing writ large for the Windrush generation. https://t.co/evAEwOPBsK

If Ministers don‚Äôt resign for the wrongful deportation of British citizens then we may as well all give up and go home. Cc: @AmberRuddHR @carolinenokes
This morning @carolinenokes said that Windrush children had been deported but didn‚Äôt know how many. This afternoon @AmberRuddHR disagreed with her own Immigration Minister. I want to know a) who is lying and b) who is resigning. Home Office needs to get this sorted out ASAP.
My parents came here as citizens, now the #windrush generation are suffering inhumane treatment at the hands of the Home Office.   If you lay down with dogs, you get fleas!  This is a day of national shame: the PM and Home Sec must apologise! https://t.co/gxqoSErU3o

The Home Secretary says she will ask High Commissioners how many Windrush children have been deported by the Home Office? It is her Department doing the deporting. She should know the number. This is a day of national shame. #Windrush https://t.co/HeZH5N6OGs
This is a day of national shame. Totally unacceptable answer from the Home Secretary. How many people have been deported? How many people have been imprisoned in their own country? How many have been denied healthcare pensions or lost their jobs? #Windrush https://t.co/HeZH5N6OGs
Exactly. A disgrace. https://t.co/2UNV1IdftZ
I am disgusted by the Home Secretary's response. She says she is worried that the Home Office is too concerned with policy and not concerned enough about individuals. Guess what, you're in charge of the Home Office. You should be considering your position because of this.
I am in Parliament about to stand up for the Windrush Generation. Shame on the Home Office that I even have to do this. Today is a dark day and brings shame on our nation. Watch my Urgent Question here #Windrush: https://t.co/CHKHbHGXEm
@JuliaHB1 @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @theresa_may @AmberRuddHR Not that you wouldnt agree with me! More that if we are in agreement that something is wrong surely the Govnt must know the game is up.
Please email and tweet your MP asking them to be in Parliament at 3:30 #Windrush
I never thought @JuliaHB1 and @Jacob_Rees_Mogg would agree with me. Time for action @theresa_may @AmberRuddHR https://t.co/GXDN3IZ6zv
This is a national disgrace and a direct result of home office hostile environments policy. These people should be returned to their homes and should expect a personal apology from the PM. https://t.co/sIiGcg9Ln2

I will not rest until this is sorted. A meeting with Commonwealth heads is a small U-turn. By the end of the day the Govnt must guarantee the status of all the Windrush children caught up in this crisis. Anything less than that is not good enough. An apology would be nice, too. https://t.co/htR7PyXaQL
This is a national disgrace. These individuals must be returned to their homes.

Wonder if it was same person who signed off having Commonwealth flags flying in Parliament Square. on the same day? A human rights scandal and a diplomatic crisis rolled into one. #Windrush #windrushjustice https://t.co/bpKxgKgiCE
Sajid please right this wrong today. This injustice cannot continue any longer. Pick up the phone to the PM and Home Secretary. Get it sorted. There is no moral or legal basis for what is going on, it shames our country and sullies our reputation. https://t.co/dUSciyrHIl
I am campaigning for an amnesty but in reality it would not be an amnesty because that word implies wrongdoing. These people have done nothing wrong. Govt must simply do the right thing, establish a humane route to clarifying their status in this country &amp; change burden of proof.
The government must immediately guarantee that anyone who comes forward to clarify their status should not face deportation or detention, because as things stand today there are thousands of people who are too worried about their future to come forward. https://t.co/1eow7Ry70j
This situation has left tens of thousands of people too scared and anxious to seek to clarify their own status for fear that they will be stripped of their status or deported back to a country that they have no memory of and is certainly not their home. Their home is here.
These individuals have done nothing wrong and there is no basis upon which the Home Office can justify what they are doing. These individuals have lived in this country for decades ‚Äì working hard, paying taxes, raising their families and contributing so much to our country.
After World War II we invited the Windrush Generation over as citizens to help rebuild our country, and now their children are being treated like criminals. The government is essentially stripping people of the rights that our government itself granted decades ago.
Thread: Today I have led 140 MPs from 6 parties urging @theresa_may to take immediate action to address the #Windrush crisis. What is going on is grotesque, immoral and inhumane. It is a stain on our nation‚Äôs conscience and the PM must act urgently to right this historic wrong. https://t.co/3XM6PXyYGF
Govnt flying Commonwealth flags in Parliament Square for heads of Govnt meeting today but PM refusing to meet with representatives  of #Windrush generation and @ukhomeoffice stripping their rights. A dark and shameful day in our history that brings great shame on our country. https://t.co/1NyO1u3hLV
Hello @theresa_may @AmberRuddHR you really need to sort this today. @Jacob_Rees_Mogg and I have never agreed on anything before. https://t.co/gWT9nH0bHT
Delighted to have support of @Jacob_Rees_Mogg who apparently just pledged his support for my letter live on @lbc and said the situation is a disgrace and shameful. If Jacob and I are in total agreement surely @ukhomeoffice will realise they need to sort this by the end of the day
My parents arrived in this country from Guyana and I stand in Parliament as a proud son of the Windrush. Thank you to 140 colleagues including @jeremycorbyn @HackneyAbbott @AngelaRayner @YvetteCooperMP @ChukaUmunna @DawnButlerBrent for joining me in writing to @theresa_may today https://t.co/O5Wl6TeGbX
Today I have led 140 MPs from 6 parties urging @theresa_may to take immediate action to deal with the Windrush immigration crisis before any more undue pain and suffering is caused. This situation is immoral and inhumane. Their home is here #Windrush https://t.co/1eow7Ry70j

This is no accident. This is what happens when toxic, insidious anti-immigrant rhetoric permeates our politics and culture. This is what happens when migrants are blamed for the faults of governments. Enough is enough. We will not put up with this. Sign: https://t.co/ac2Ua2XTGc
#Windrush situation totally shameful. That these individuals are being treated with such contempt, disrespect and lack of dignity is a national disgrace. This is happening in our names. Pls raise your voice and say not in my name - send a message to the PM https://t.co/ac2Ua2XTGc
Delighted to see cross party consensus growing. This historic injustice will overshadow Commonwealth heads of Govnt meeting this week. Govnt must do right thing and confirm status of Windrush Generation and change burden of proof. Tomorrow morning would be as good a time as any. https://t.co/LXv8iff3Uk
Sorry state of affairs when the children of the Windrush Generation are being stripped of their rights and facing deportation after living and working here for decades. Please will you have a word with the PM - she has refused to meet with 12 representatives to discuss? Thanks. https://t.co/iYt9ODWCYb
Hideous. I thought you wanted trade deals with Commonwealth countries @theresa_may? This is an insult and a slap in the face. This brings great shame on our country. I will be raising as a matter of urgency in Parliament when Parliament returns tomorrow. https://t.co/XUQUddTbMV
Awful. I won't let them get away with this. Our Govt invited the Windrush Generation to Britain as citizens to rebuild our country in the wake of WWII. That these individuals are being treated with such contempt, disrespect and lack of dignity is shameful. https://t.co/XUQUddTbMV
Lest we forget..... https://t.co/eGkH9NdF7Q
We did it!! Thank you so much to the 100,000+ people who signed the petition. I will not rest until this wrong is righted. The government must grant an immediate amnesty, change the burden of proof and apologise for this historic and inhumane injustice. https://t.co/ac2Ua2XTGc
5,000 to go until we get a debate in Parliament. Please sign and share the petition @LennyHenry @garyyounge @DavidHarewood @HackneyAbbott @ppvernon https://t.co/ac2Ua2XTGc
This is a big one! Fingers crossed for a great night! C‚Äômon you Spurs. #COYS #THFC #TOTMCI https://t.co/ffaof2DVh7
@DavidHarewood @HackneyAbbott is hosting a public meeting in Parliament on Thursday and I am hosting a meeting 1st May and have invited @AmberRuddHR to explain what @ukhomeoffice are doing to these individuals. Would be great if you could make either.
Real talk ‚¨áÔ∏è. https://t.co/ac2Ua2XTGc https://t.co/sZpNyppP8W
Let‚Äôs get to 100,000 this weekend so the Home Secretary has to come to Parliament to explain this injustice. https://t.co/ac2Ua2XTGc https://t.co/34gj0J8Il2
So if you the Government won‚Äôt take Syrian children stranded in Europe because this is apparently not ‚Äòright‚Äô, how many have come directly from Syria? Look forward to publication of ambitious Govnt target and strategy for taking Syrian refugees when Parliament returns on Monday. https://t.co/4QbZtPiTqM
Questions for those disagreeing on this point:  1) why were Tory MPs whipped to vote against letting in Syrian child refugees 2) why was Dubs amendment closed to prevent Syrian child refugees coming  3) how many refugees has the government taken from Syria so far? What is target?
It isn‚Äôt me saying it, read the Home Affairs Committee report. Only c.200 children refugee resettled under Dubs scheme. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, described the government‚Äôs approach as ‚Äúcompletely inadequate‚Äù. https://t.co/lADc1H0zGk https://t.co/QfGd978czQ
‚ÄúTherefore in safety‚Äù. Wow. Have you been to a refugee camp in Greece or Calais Nick? Please do.  For what reason were Conservative MPs whipped to vote against taking in a few thousand refugee children? For what reason was the Dubs scheme ended after a couple of hundred children? https://t.co/9Rtkkg3xZN
We have today found ourself in the morally untenable position of bombing Syria without Parliament voting at the same time as refusing to take in child refugees who are fleeing the bombing in Syria. As a society we must reflect hard on how we have ended up in this situation.
Any MPs supporting military action and air strikes: do you remember the night in Spring 2016 when Parliament voted down the Dubs amendment to take in a few thousand children fleeing war and bloodshed in Syria? Reflect on why you now prioritise air strikes over taking in refugees.
Me too, Andrew. https://t.co/WU9VBRtI4A
I am not convinced that this military action will contribute towards peace in Syria or make the world a safer place. The case has not been made and the government has failed to set out how this action is part of a wider strategy of bringing peace and stability to the region.(2/2)
Statement on Syria:  PM is wrong to take military action in Syria without any recourse to Parliament. I have serious reservations - why was the PM not prepared to listen to all sides? Why has the PM sidelined Parliament and instead taken orders directly from Donald Trump? (1/2)
A tour de force by @Sathnam. Time for Oxbridge to stop making excuses and take responsibility. Also featuring the peerless @missvarz https://t.co/MMgrzmTm6e

What is going on is a stain on our nation's conscience. After WWII we invited the Windrush Generation over as citizens to help rebuild our country, and now their children are being treated like criminals. The Home Sec and PM can right this historic wrong: https://t.co/ac2Ua2XTGc
This is not a glitch in the system. This is the system. These people have violated no law, it is the law that is violating them. @garyyounge must read article on disgraceful treatment of the children of the Windrush generation. https://t.co/2chKf42DD5 https://t.co/3DjxqRZziV
Wonderful. Greig City Academy @Greig_City @GCASailingClub are off to Antigua Sailing Week @SailingWeek. @CatherineWest1 and I are proud MPs of these fantastic young people! https://t.co/4c2WPj7gug

Damning report into companies relabelling low-skilled jobs as apprenticeships. It is also scandalous that companies can call low-skilled jobs apprenticeships to let them get away with paying their staff ¬£3.70 per hour instead of a fair wage for their work. https://t.co/CArtHtpw01
Sign the petition. Share with your family &amp; friends. Spread the word. Write to your MP. We can change this. We owe it to 1000‚Äôs of people and to our nation‚Äôs conscience. It is not an amnesty - it is protecting the rights that were their rights all along.   https://t.co/ac2Ua2XTGc
Not only is the Govnt unilaterally stripping people of the rights that the Govnt itself gave them decades, they have imposed a prohibitively expensive and almost impossibly complex burden of proof on mostly elderly people who have lived here for all of almost all of their lives.
This is grotesque, immoral and inhumane. The government is retrospectively revoking citizenship rights that our government itself granted but failed to record properly decades ago. I will fight against this historic injustice with every bone in my body until this wrong is righted https://t.co/eaUhvhFszM
The Windrush Generation - fighting for their rights in the face of the Home Office treating them like criminals. Please watch this then sign the petition https://t.co/SmoO3MSA4L
Post-Grenfell our fire testing and building regulations regime requires an overhaul, and it frankly beggars belief that the Govnt would even consider maintaining a testing regime that would allow combustible materials to be cleared for use on high rise buildings without testing.
I‚Äôm pleased that, after considerable pressure, @sajidjavid @mhclg has announced what appears to be a step in the right direction, but I‚Äôm surprised that he feels the need to consult on whether desktop studies should be scrapped. https://t.co/fWrRuSVJOR

Good column on the intersection of gang violence, turf wars, poverty, entrenched disadvantage and lack of support under austerity. "Children don‚Äôt grow up in a vacuum. If the world can‚Äôt offer them a path they will turn to antisocial alternatives that do". https://t.co/jQJYjwujkz
