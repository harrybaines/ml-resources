Honda's decision to close its factory in Swindon is a huge blow to the thousands of workers and the whole community.  The government's disastrous handling of Brexit is letting people down across the country.  https://t.co/E6MK8DuVcB
The Tories are bungling Brexit while Labour has set out a unifying and credible alternative plan. When millions face the misery of Universal Credit, rising crime, homelessness and poverty, now more than ever is the time to bring people together to build a better future for us all
Labour won people over on a programme for the many not the few – redistributing wealth and power, taking vital resources into public ownership, investing in every region and nation, and tackling climate change.
I am disappointed that these MPs have felt unable to continue to work together for the Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election and saw us increase our vote by the largest share since 1945.
I’m very sad at the passing of my good friend Paul Flynn. He had such love for Newport, knowledge of radical South Wales history and a dry wit. He was an independent thinker who was a credit to the Labour Party. He will be greatly missed.
NHS staff are the lifeblood of our healthcare system. We cannot afford to lose them.  https://t.co/VXRIYh7ZFH
Labour will end the failed free-market experiment in higher education, crack down on vice-chancellors’ pay and improve academic diversity.  Education is a right for the many, not a privilege for the few.  https://t.co/Ehru7PTenC

So sad to hear that Andrea Levy, born in Islington, has died. Her parents arrived in Britain on the Empire Windrush. Andrea's immense writing not only shows the terrible racism her and her parents' generations suffered, but chronicles their immense contribution to this country.

Yet again, Theresa May's Brexit deal has been defeated. https://t.co/6fBTIAxgve
Tonight’s vote showed there is no majority for the Prime Minister's Brexit plan.  She needs to admit her strategy has failed, shift her red lines and come back with a proposal that can truly command support in Parliament.
The Conservatives are ripping the heart out of the British economy. https://t.co/mA7m6kmcna

It’s the failed system, rigged against the many to protect the interests of the few, that's the real cause of inequality and insecurity.  The solution is to transform Britain to work in the interests of the vast majority. That's how we can heal the referendum’s deep divisions. https://t.co/lvj4YzupHI
The real divide in our country is not between those who voted to remain in the EU referendum and those who voted to leave.  It is between the many, who do the work, create the wealth and pay taxes - and the few, who set the rules, reap the rewards and so often dodge taxes. https://t.co/W7aB6JgJG6
To break the deadlock over Theresa May's botched Brexit deal, a General Election is the most practical and democratic option.  It would give the winning party a renewed mandate to negotiate a better deal for Britain and secure support for it in Parliament and across the country. https://t.co/JIdHUoSOq1
A government that cannot get its business through parliament is no government at all.  So I say to Theresa May: if you are so confident in your deal, call a General Election and let the people decide. https://t.co/pU0K4kpyzl

That is why we are taking every opportunity possible in Parliament to prevent no deal.   Theresa May must now rule out no deal once and for all.

In 2019, there may be a General Election and I can’t wait.  https://t.co/RWF30iXHdR
My thoughts are with the family and friends of Paddy Ashdown.  He represented Yeovil very well and I got to know him in the 1980s when we often found ourselves voting in parliament together against damaging government policies.  He will be greatly missed.

Today is Ali al-Nimr's 24th birthday. He remains in prison because he took part in a peaceful protest in Saudi Arabia - when he was 17.  I stand by my 2015 demand: the UK Government must pressure Saudi Arabia to release him and every other unlawfully detained political prisoner. https://t.co/PGTV7OJQth
Yesterday the Tories and much of the media created a phoney row about something I didn't say.  Here's why... https://t.co/AADuxGiW3D
"We should operate according to the old principle — from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs."  As @RLong_Bailey says, we need socialism to make real progress on climate change. #COP24  https://t.co/2eCCwGIEko
Every year since the Tories entered government in 2010 rough sleeping has got worse. There is absolutely no excuse for this.  https://t.co/CysdrMC22b

Edinburgh is a fantastic city, but it's being let down by austerity. https://t.co/1XcrhQSID1
No one should be rough sleeping, especially in the middle of winter.   And it's a disgrace that the number of people sleeping rough has risen every year under the Tories.   We need real action. Here's our plan:  https://t.co/fv1knajb9q
It is unacceptable for the country to wait another month before Parliament has the chance to vote on Theresa May's botched deal.  Therefore I have tabled a motion of no confidence in the PM this evening, so Parliament can take back control. #NoConfidence https://t.co/IRXeaScpZm
Today the Tories have been dragged kicking and screaming to announce a date to vote on Theresa May's botched Brexit deal. https://t.co/imLLe7akAY
Agreeing a 'rulebook' to put the Paris climate agreement into practice is important, but we need much more to achieve #ClimateJusticeNow.  Big polluters like the USA and Russia must shoulder the biggest responsibility, not collude with oil producers to block progress. #COP24

The last 24 hours have shown that Theresa May’s Brexit deal is dead in the water.  She's failed to deliver any meaningful changes.  Rather than ploughing ahead and recklessly running down the clock, she needs to put her deal to a vote next week so Parliament can take back control
One hundred years ago today was the first General Election in British history where women could vote and stand.  This victory was won by suffragettes who sacrificed so much and in Emily Wilding Davison's case, her life. https://t.co/MJ0iRQcXIf
The Tories have utterly failed the people of this country.  https://t.co/7WBrPFhpML
It's clear after Theresa May went back to Brussels today that there'll be no changes to her botched Brexit deal.  There must be no more delays or attempts to run down the clock to deny Parliament alternative options.  There's no time to waste and Parliament must take back control
Tonight's vote changes nothing.  Theresa May has lost her majority in Parliament, her Government is in chaos and she's unable to deliver a Brexit deal that works for the country and puts jobs and the economy first.  She must now bring her botched deal back to Parliament next week
There is chaos at the core of Theresa May's Government.  #PMQs https://t.co/WyHb1e3FkR

It's disgusting to see racism plague our national game in recent weeks.   And deeply troubling that players have come to expect abuse which should have no place anywhere in society.   Racism must be confronted and defeated on the terraces, in the streets and wherever it surfaces.
We don't have a functioning government.  Theresa May is trying to buy herself one last chance to save this deal.  But if she doesn’t secure the changes required then she must make way for those who can. #BrexitVote #BrexitShambles https://t.co/4XtclmhXha

The Prime Minister’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster.  From day one, @Theresa_May has looked incapable of delivering a good deal for Britain.  The political games from both the EU and our Government need to end because no deal is not an option.

Congratulations to @wolfalicemusic on winning the #MercuryPrize. Well deserved. And thank you for the great support you gave @UKLabour in the 2017 General Election.  We should all listen to them about the importance of music education: https://t.co/cV84hGJFw1 #MercuryMusicPrize
It's dangerously short-sighted to cut funding for public health.   We'll do things very differently, starting with fully-funded, preventative schemes to ensure the health of the nation. https://t.co/fVwyXxx305
Railways in Britain are a complete shambles. Passengers are paying more while performances are declining rapidly.  Transport Minister Chris Grayling is totally incapable of running the railways and fails to grasp how to improve them.  We need change.  https://t.co/D2ZlqsN1hK
Under the Tories, the cost of living has gone up.  We're all paying the price for Tory austerity.  Labour will rebuild our economy so it works for the many not the few. https://t.co/tCKl6cdJ6Y
We can't shy away from the fact that Britain is facing a housing crisis.  And yet, with new council housing at a record low, the Tories are announcing a cut in the house-building budget.  We'll rebuild Britain properly, starting with 1 million new genuinely affordable homes.

Today we said goodbye to a brilliant @GMB_union official and Islington Councillor, Gary Doolan.  In honour of Gary, who worked as a caretaker for years, a procession of cleaning trucks drove by St Mary's church before the funeral - a service he campaigned to bring back in house. https://t.co/N1ah5dPXOD

We don't have to sit back and watch as a handful of big tech corporations hoover up digital rights and our money. We can #ChangeTheMedia.  https://t.co/YYCwZnSlKX
One of the more radical and interesting possible ways to limit the power of unaccountable media barons is to give journalists the power to elect editors and have seats on boards for workers and consumers when a title or programme gets particularly large and influential.
For all the worry about new forms of fake news, most people think our newspapers churn out fake news day in, day out.  It’s hardly a surprise in the last 4 years one political earthquake after another has been missed by most of our media.
We must break the stranglehold of elite power and billionaire domination over large parts of our media.   Just three companies control 71% of national newspaper circulation and 5 companies control 81% of local newspaper circulation.
Print too often sets the broadcast agenda, even though it is wedded so firmly to the Tories politically and to corporate interests more generally.   Just because it's on the front page of The Sun or the Mail doesn't automatically make it news. #ChangeTheMedia

Estate regeneration must put local people first.   In London @SadiqKhan is doing just that by using Labour policies to protect social housing and give residents a real say - before any development takes place.  https://t.co/yzn5yrcazF
Theresa May's ministers must fully cooperate with the police investigation into Vote Leave. #PMQs https://t.co/WN8Y0veBVd
The @Conservatives can't meet the needs of the country because they are too busy fighting each other. #PMQs https://t.co/uwf4ADCMIz
Nelson Mandela was born 100 years ago today.  He continues to inspire. https://t.co/xkpgppRsx9
Labour in government will deepen our commitment to UN peacekeeping and work with allies who strive for peace, diplomacy and real security for all. https://t.co/tm61DV8T2u
I'm proud to lead a party founded by trade unions, supported by trade unions and am proud to be a trade unionist myself.  My speech at the #DurhamMinersGala. https://t.co/RGV15DG18k
Great to watch the #WorldCupFinal with Jubba Youth Community Association, an organisation that uses football to support young people.  This tournament has shown the power of football to inspire and bring people together.  Thanks @PlatformHub for putting on the game. https://t.co/ac84mA9DkB
England's #WorldCup run has shown the power football has to inspire and bring people together.  So today Labour says we should bid to host it in 2030. https://t.co/uQOHFzl7EU
All children deserve the education that the #DurhamMinersGala provides.  That's why schools should teach children about the trade union principles of solidarity and collective action, so they are equipped to uphold their rights as workers. https://t.co/IhbR7PIIvR
The #DurhamMinersGala shows the strength of our movement.  History teaches us that those at the top never conceded anything without it being demanded from those below.  That's why the trade union movement is essential to us building a country that works for the many, not the few. https://t.co/oXwKQv1aKv
Always great to catch up with Dennis Skinner, a giant of the trade union movement.  #DurhamMinersGala https://t.co/ehLcOc6cZ7
Trade unions have been vilified for too long.  Schools need to teach children about the principles of solidarity and collective action and equip them to uphold their rights as workers. #DurhamMinersGala  https://t.co/yC0hGkhwlk https://t.co/qRTbCxWvyJ
Really looking forward to today's @DurhamGala.  The Gala reminds us what we can achieve when we stand together to fight for our common goals of peace, prosperity and social justice.  My Northern Echo article on the #BigMeeting  https://t.co/1CMBr6gjHm #durhamminersgala
Our message today to President Donald Trump was: We're united in our hope for a world of justice not division.  #TrumpProtest #TrumpVisitsUK https://t.co/aJRQtO2vwP
We’re asserting our right to free speech and our right to demonstrate for a better world.  When we divide ourselves by racism, misogyny and hate, we all lose.  When we are united in hope, with common goals, we can all win.  #TrumpProtest #TrumpVisitsUK https://t.co/W32i2FkJEV
Donald Trump is visiting Britain but has avoided meeting any ordinary people. #TrumpVisitUK #TrumpProtests https://t.co/h6oVUeBvx6
Earlier this week I met Arab ambassadors from across the region. We spoke about how to work together on a range of issues including the refugee crisis, ending conflict and building peace. https://t.co/bTpmhTY5Ib
Theresa May has invited President Trump to our country at a time when his dangerous and inhumane policies are putting the lives and wellbeing of millions of people at risk. #TrumpUKVisit https://t.co/69HdBTzkji
Great to be at the @AFCCommunity Award ceremony to celebrate the achievement of people on their programmes and thank @Arsenal for their work across communities in north London.  The past month has shown the power football has to inspire and bring people together.  #AITAwars https://t.co/wRO9fQRMcu
The Government has finally admitted that @Theresa_May's 'hostile environment' is wrong.  A temporary pause is not good enough. The Prime Minister must end this policy that has ruined people's lives.   https://t.co/zX3kLbKnmI
Tory cuts have denied a generation of children the opportunities they deserve.   The next Labour government, with @AngelaRayner as Education Secretary, will give our schools the staff and resources they need, as part of a new National Education Service.   https://t.co/sd8rZZE8ek
The new Health Secretary @MattHancock has voted for more privatisation of our NHS and taken money from donors who want to scrap it.  The NHS is not safe in Tory hands.  https://t.co/IlOlv3N6Fz
Disgraceful to sneak this out while the rest of the country comes together for the #ENGCRO match.  Finally they have accepted that @Theresa_May's 'hostile environment' is wrong.  But for those who have had their lives ruined this is nowhere near enough.  https://t.co/V3g4oapB3J
A heartbreaking way to go out but won't forget what a great tournament it's been for @England.  @GarethSouthgate and his team have brought the country together and delivered our best World Cup result since 1990.  They should be extremely proud. We certainly are. #ENGCRO #WorldCup
I hope bosses have been flexible with the millions of evening workers who want to watch England take on Croatia tonight.  It's been a fantastic tournament and we're only one win away from a first #WorldCup final since 1966. Good luck @England. #ENGCRO   https://t.co/8gPspbIJ1U
@CatSmithMP Delighted for you and Ben. Just in time for the #WorldCup semi final!   Look forward to seeing the three of you soon.
England's diverse group of footballers have been a credit to the nation during this #WorldCup. And it's great that they've supported @SRTRC_England. Wishing them the best of luck against Croatia   #ShowRacismtheRedCard #ENGCRO https://t.co/gEnPZlDaPT
It speaks volumes that this is who @Theresa_May has chosen to lead her Tory Brexit. https://t.co/nB6akQMzBB
Fantastic to hear that the boys in Thailand and their football coach have all been rescued. Incredible effort from all those involved - and well done to the British divers who were so integral to getting them out safely.
Proud to join service personnel to mark the centenary of the RAF at a service in Westminster Abbey.  We give our thanks to everyone who has served and continues to serve, and remember the brave pilots who played a vital role in defeating fascism in World War II. #RAF100 https://t.co/kQptpoWuio
Rough sleeping has more than doubled under the Tories.  With this appointment, people will wonder if Theresa May really cares.  https://t.co/YNQ3REt7lS
We need a government that is capable of governing. https://t.co/HWvoxyEyVw
David Davis resigning at such a crucial time shows @Theresa_May has no authority left and is incapable of delivering Brexit.   With her Government in chaos, if she clings on, it's clear she's more interested in hanging on for her own sake than serving the people of our country.
I'm shocked by the death of Dawn Sturgess. My thoughts are with her family and friends at this terrible time. A full and thorough police investigation must now establish the facts, provide support to the local community and bring those responsible to justice.
One year ago today I was proud to speak at the Durham Miners' Gala - it is one of the greatest celebrations of working class culture in our country.  Join me and thousands of others this Saturday at 2018's Durham Miner's Gala: https://t.co/iZHDmmhgLC https://t.co/rmtXJNutK8
Michael Boye-Anawomah was born in Ghana in 1935 and after coming to Britain he became Islington's first black councillor.  He was dedicated to working for his community and inspiring others to do the same.  I'll miss hearing his wise words of advice.  https://t.co/yQYHfiCD9m https://t.co/LjAzjv3arl
Fantastic result, into the #WorldCup semi finals for the first time since 1990. Public holiday getting closer.  Gareth Southgate and these players have brought the nation together and are doing us proud. #ENGSWE
Great event at Brickworks Community Centre in my constituency. A wonderful new centre providing services and support to the community, and today bringing people together in this beautiful weather. https://t.co/BiSDpVTvoS
It was a pleasure to meet NHS workers in Grays in Thurrock today.  The NHS's 70th birthday is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate our country's greatest institution and the hardworking staff who make it the greatest healthcare system in the world.  #NHS70 #OurNHS70 https://t.co/UmqYX7AEOC

In #SchoolDiversityWeek2018, I want to thank @DiversityRM for its work taking positive role models into schools.  It educates young people about difference, challenges stereotypes and addresses the misuse of language.  Find out more here: https://t.co/5tiQmLXacT https://t.co/AkLDkwfbvG
This week the Government has asked young people to celebrate our democracy, but at the same time is denying so many of them a say in the future of our country.  Great article by @CatSmithMP.  https://t.co/jyeA1dyNSL
My message to our sister parties in Europe is simple: reject austerity or the voters will reject you. https://t.co/OwdXhW5LMI
Good to meet the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte in The Hague today.  We discussed Brexit, a UK-EU trade deal and how to protect our steel industries – as well as the conflicts driving the devastating refugee crisis around Europe. https://t.co/cEEehleFMQ
If we rediscover our radical purpose, this moment can be ours to forge a new economic consensus to replace the rigged system that has failed working class people, fuelled inequality and sucked wealth away from the majority to an elite few.  https://t.co/cNjVVtywRc
It’s time for change in Europe. If we don’t lead that change, others will.  The broken system has provided fertile ground for xenophobia and scapegoating.  We must offer a clear and radical alternative, and hope for a fairer, richer future.
I am in the Netherlands today with a simple message for our European sister parties: reject austerity or face rejection by voters.  If we look like another part of the establishment, we will be rejected – and the migrant-baiters of the far right will fill the gap. https://t.co/4MPqlINLA1
If we're serious about fulfilling Nye Bevan's dream of creating a society that looks after everybody, we have to fight for it, and we have to transform our economy. #NHS70 https://t.co/0oYNvjIiuE

There's a long way to go, but if England win the #WorldCup the Government should declare a public holiday as a day of national celebration.  https://t.co/Q5Wfoh8jpO
Today at Prime Minister’s Questions, I asked @Theresa_May about the crisis in our bus services.  She didn't answer my questions and Tory MPs laughed at the very idea I might raise the issue.  They showed just how out of touch they are. #PMQs https://t.co/HFQkZG05sR
For 30 years, the media and the establishment tried to tell us that class doesn't matter any more.  We've seen where that's got us.  The next Labour government will put the interests of the working class, in all its diversity, centre stage.  https://t.co/a0F82NHg9b
Labour is back as the political voice of the working class, in all its diversity, all across Britain. #UPC2018 https://t.co/AWSkb4oNfu
Win or lose this evening, the #WorldCup is inspiring the next generation of footballers.  I'm passionate about grassroots sport and the next Labour government will back and fund it properly.  #ENGCOL https://t.co/dY2VkoES2V
We will transform society. But change has never been gifted from above, it has always been fought for by people demanding it.  The next Labour government will put the interests of the working class, in all its diversity, centre stage.  #UPC2018
A pleasure to speak to @unitetheunion members to say Labour is back as the political voice of the working class.  In the last 30 years, workers’ living standards have fallen while a tiny minority have got richer.  Our communities have been held back for too long.  #UPC2018 https://t.co/edZsUvzqjU
I hope bosses are flexible with the millions of evening workers who want to watch England take on Colombia.  Hoping for the first win in a knockout round in 12 years. #ENGCOL  https://t.co/8gPspbIJ1U

Ninety years ago today all women won the right to vote, under the Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928.  Labour has secured a Parliamentary debate on Thursday to celebrate this momentous achievement and the working class women who fought for it.
I spent Friday in Scotland, Saturday in London and yesterday in Wales campaigning with people who will go to the ends of the earth and beyond to fight for healthcare as a right for all. #NHS70 https://t.co/Jmwh4ZrXQR
Today brings a new beginning for México.  Congratulations @lopezobrador_. His election as President with more than 50% of the vote offers the poor and marginalised a genuine voice for the first time in Mexico's modern history.  I'm sure #AMLO will be a president for all Mexicans. https://t.co/UE7oCDy4pP
My thoughts are with the family and friends of Dr Julian Tudor Hart who sadly died today.   Julian was a pioneer of quality primary care and President of the Socialist Health Association. We will continue to be inspired by his work to campaign against inequalities in healthcare.
"If we don't fight for the NHS we lose ourselves as a country."  @JohnnyVegasReal sums it up. #NHS70  https://t.co/v7NQMOTRFl
After the brilliant #BevanFestival in Tredegar I travelled to Barry where there was another packed venue of people who have had enough of the Tories failing our NHS.  On its 70th birthday, we must come together to campaign to defend healthcare as a human right. #OurNHS #NHS70 https://t.co/MUzyx0aCYx
Labour will make corporations stump up funds for our National Health Service. #bbcsp https://t.co/O9ZWY8AK9R
Today we celebrated the NHS's 70th birthday in Tredegar, the birthplace Nye Bevan.  Out of the rubble and devastation of the Second World War we built the world's first comprehensive public healthcare system.

Espero que las próximas elecciones en México sean pacíficas y se respete el proceso electoral.  Lamento mucho la pérdida de vidas en el transcurso de las elecciones. En memoria de los candidatos fallecidos, espero que la democracia, la justicia y los derechos humanos prevalezcan.
.@RobDelaney movingly explains why the NHS is so important to him.  He reminds us of the battle in America for a national health service and healthcare to be provided as a right, not a privilege for those who can afford it. #NHS70 #OurNHS70 https://t.co/9alK4v7I68
Our NHS is on its knees after eight years of Tory underfunding, privatisation and failure.  That is why on its 70th birthday, we must come together to campaign to save it.  We must defend healthcare as a human right. #OurNHS #NHS70 https://t.co/1P3ASKq0oG
This Thursday we celebrate our NHS's 70th birthday.  Out of the rubble and devastation of the Second World War a Labour government built the world's first comprehensive public healthcare system.  It's Labour's and our country's proudest achievement. #OurNHS #NHS70 https://t.co/VWlCcYW0qQ

Today I'll visit the Al-Baqa'a refugee camp which was first created in 1968, where 100,000 Palestinians live.  The next Labour government will recognise Palestine as a state as one step towards a genuine two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. https://t.co/eyKgvGCAGo

Eight years ago today the Tories set their first austerity Budget.  From the backbenches, @JohnMcDonnellMP said we should tackle tax avoidance and evasion rather than slash funding to our vital public services.  Austerity is a political choice, not an economic necessity. https://t.co/ZsJ9Q7awr8
Eight years ago today the Tories set their first austerity Budget, saying "we're all in this together".  £110 billion in tax giveaways to corporations while cutting funding to our NHS, schools and police shows they've worked for an elite few, not the many. https://t.co/uxgf7opnjO
The first members of the Windrush Generation arrived 70 years ago today at Tilbury Docks.  They need justice and their rightful place, with all the dignity and prominence they deserve, in our country's history. #WindrushGeneration #Windrush70 https://t.co/gTHBDs9i0P

How can we hold companies to account for hiding money our country needs for public services when their owners are kept secret?  Labour won't tolerate the immoral scourge of tax dodging because, unlike the Tories, we're not in the pockets of the super-rich. https://t.co/xNkEYcPGVe
Tories must stop covering up the extent of the Windrush crisis and the human cost of their "hostile environment".  We still do not know how many people have been deported, detained and denied their rights.  The Windrush Generation need answers and justice. https://t.co/T58kurTGdv

Doctors, nurses and patients know our NHS is in crisis. The money announced by @theresa_may isn't enough to fix the damage the Tories have done.   Labour's fully costed plans to raise taxes for the top 5% and big business will increase NHS spending to the level it needs.

The Tories' NHS funding announcement is nowhere near enough, after eight years of cuts and privatisation.  Our NHS is on its knees, ask any nurse, doctor or patient.  Labour will properly fund our NHS with a real long term plan that includes social care.  https://t.co/hRuCF1Ab0Q
Absolutely tragic that millions of people face starvation in West Africa’s Sahel region. Parents are taking children out of school and foregoing essential medicine just so they can buy food.  We must do more to help stop this terrible humanitarian crisis.  https://t.co/xSKkWdSAtb
We can, and will, do things very differently. #LabourLive https://t.co/M6k3khJTqb
The next Labour government will give our NHS the funding it needs, ensure everyone has a home to call their own and build a world class education system.  Together, we can win the next election and form a government that works for the many, not the few.#LabourLive https://t.co/lK4YkluKBk

Two years ago today, our brilliant colleague Jo Cox was taken from us.  We miss her commitment to fighting injustice and her conviction that a better world is possible.  Jo’s maiden speech reminded us we have 'more in common than that which divides us'. https://t.co/3GR3c2tiA1

Solidarity with hospital staff at Mid Yorkshire NHS trust who have voted to take strike action.  Like workers at Wigan hospital, who I met last week, these estates and facilities staff are challenging plans to outsource their jobs and take away their NHS terms and conditions.
When I last asked @Theresa_May about school cuts at #PMQs she said the Tories are "ensuring that there is more money available".  We know that's not true, but will she listen now teachers at one of her local schools are begging her for basic equipment?  https://t.co/CJkNof97LU
Delighted to join Labour MPs to meet the traders running the crucial #SaveOurArches campaign.   Small businesses around the country are under threat from Network Rail’s plan to sell 5,500 railway arches. The sell-off must be stopped. https://t.co/hLZaoPOzGm

Half a million people a year will be diagnosed with cancer by 2035.  Today, @CRUK_Policy demands the Government stands #ShoulderToShoulder with NHS workers - by training and employing the staff our NHS will need to diagnose and treat cancer patients.

Today’s Saudi-led attack on a Yemeni port city could cost thousands of lives and leave millions of Yemenis without food, medicine and fuel.  The Government must halt its support for this terrible conflict and act to bring the humanitarian disaster in Yemen to an end.
Great to see Labour MPs stay after #PMQs to support our colleague @AnnaMcMorrin propose a change to the law so producers take responsibility for their packaging  12.7 million tonnes of plastic waste ends up in our oceans each year. It's vital action is taken now. https://t.co/Ab5YKXv76S

Two years on, we will never forget the 49 people murdered in an appalling attack on the LGBT+ community in Florida.  The Pulse shooting remains a stark reminder that, despite legislative progress, we have a long way to go until LGBT+ people across the globe can live in safety.

Today, I responded to the Prime Minister’s statement on the G7 which was a failure because of the current incumbent of the White House. https://t.co/vayRETllpo
#CarersWeek2018 is a good time to remember the 6.5 million unpaid carers for whom every week is #CarersWeek, and to reflect on the huge contribution that they make.  My full statement: https://t.co/ALQLkktY7G https://t.co/s5Y552zbSx
The next Labour government will ensure everyone has a home to call their own. We will fix the housing crisis by building a million new homes, the majority will be social housing and genuinely affordable, as we build a country for the many, not the few. #EndHomelessness
Labour will introduce radical, ground-breaking policies that tackle homelessness head on, making 8,000 new homes available for people with a history of rough sleeping. #EndHomelessness
As Prime Minister I will personally lead a task force to end rough sleeping by the end of the next Parliament, working across government to make the links between housing, health, social security and work. #EndHomelessness https://t.co/wLsBEVVhmD
Today, @Crisis_UK released research showing that an average of three homeless people have died every week since last October.  That's someone’s child, parent or friend dying needlessly because our Government hasn't got the political will to #EndHomelessness. https://t.co/3GX9gA7SQd
There are 236,000 people who are homeless in the UK.   It is simply inexcusable that in Britain, one of the richest countries in the world, we are still failing to give everyone a decent and secure place to live. #EndHomelessness https://t.co/K09bUggIuS
Today, I spoke at @Crisis_UK and congratulated them on their 50th anniversary.  It was an honour to be with so many dedicated people who do so much to end the scourge of homelessness, including many who are or have been homeless themselves. #EndHomelessness https://t.co/SBTT38N40Z
Today I'll be speaking @Crisis_UK about how we must #EndHomelessness and make sure everyone has a home to call their own. https://t.co/kh8kVR27VZ
We’ll make sure workers keep 100% of their tips. #KeepTheTip https://t.co/tSp89yFUJz
@JennetteArnold It's been my pleasure working with you. Thank you for all your support.
In January, bosses at TGI Fridays decided to strip waiting staff of 40% of their card tips.  Great to meet workers who have campaigned tirelessly against this.  The next Labour government will make sure staff keep 100% of their hard-earned tips. #KeepTheTip https://t.co/LtrVSWzPar
I was proud to speak at the Bakers' Union conference today.  This year, their #McStrike campaign led to the first strike in McDonald's history in our country - and secured better pay and conditions for workers.  @bfawu1 and its members’ fierce campaigning is an inspiration. https://t.co/9D0cjOjdpJ
We've announced that the next Labour government will make sure workers keep 100% of their hard-earned tips.  Thanks to @UniteTheUnion for their brilliant @FairHospitality campaign, standing up for workers in the hospitality sector.  https://t.co/xYnNyXCTEe
Thirty-five years ago today, I was proud to be elected as an MP for the first time. I have learned so much from the people of Islington North. Now as leader of @UKLabour, I'm honoured to meet and learn from people across the UK about how we can build a fairer, more equal society.
It's not right that workers have their tips stolen by their bosses.  I’m proud to announce that the next Labour government will make it illegal, ensuring workers keep 100% of their hard-earned tips.   https://t.co/LfYRa8gEjd
The Government promised a “detailed, ambitious and precise” Brexit White Paper this month setting out their negotiating priorities.   Once again it’s been postponed.  The Tories are botching Brexit and risking jobs and our economy in the process.  https://t.co/3ZRSnFKRnA

Disgraceful. While these 100,000 families wait for a home for over a decade, most are stuck in overcrowded, expensive and insecure accommodation.   The Tories have refused to build the social housing we need, meaning numbers have fallen to a record low.  https://t.co/QRapMSL7nu

Thousands of UK workers are under threat from Donald Trump’s reckless steel tariffs.   Leaders of the world’s richest countries meet today in Canada at the G7 - workers need @Theresa_May to stand up to Trump’s bullying.  My article in today's @DailyMirror: https://t.co/ZiiQjxeoVc
One year ago today, we overcame the odds and took away the Tories’ majority.  @Theresa_May underestimated the Labour Party and, more importantly, she underestimated you.  As I said a year ago, together we can win the next election and build a country for the many, not the few. https://t.co/aDXSNz1XsO
Great campaigning in Lewisham East with Labour's candidate in next week's by-election, @JanetDaby.  As an MP, Janet will work tirelessly to ensure our NHS gets the funding it needs, for an end to rip-off rail privatisation and for more social - and affordable - housing. https://t.co/GD26dWLRYJ
The UK Government must now listen to campaigners and launch an independent inquiry into the brutal clashes between police and miners during the strike in 1984, not least at Orgreave where so many questions still need to be answered.
The convictions of nearly 500 Scottish miners devastated not only their lives, but those of their families too while also scarring pit communities until this day.  This review must establish if these arrests and convictions were unjust and politically motivated.
I welcome the Scottish Government's announcement that there will be an independent review into the actions of the police during the miners' strike in Scotland.  I pay tribute to the campaigners and my colleague @NeilFindlay_MSP who have fought tirelessly to make this happen.
But, the @Conservatives have rigged our system in favour of a privileged elite. The next Labour government will transform our country so it works for the many, not the few.
Make no mistake, Britain has the wealth and resources to organise our economy so everyone can lead a decent life, with a home to call their own, a job that pays enough for them to live on, with access to education and the opportunities to succeed.
I read this article this morning and it made me shudder with anger.  One person going hungry in the sixth richest country in the world is wrong. But four million people having to use foodbanks is absolutely shocking.  https://t.co/ONbzUKn4aj
It's clearer than ever that paying private companies to deliver public services and projects has completely failed.  The @Conservatives' obsession with outsourcing has not only put services at risk, it is costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.  https://t.co/kzxr1vUu0R
50 years ago today, a historic strike took place which led to a watershed moment in the fight for gender equality.  187 machinists at Ford’s Dagenham plant walked out and onto the picket line because they were being paid less than their male colleagues.  https://t.co/dtyUtYq4wF https://t.co/ef7iSMuP0o
Sad to hear of the death of Mary Wilson. A wonderful poet and a huge support in Harold’s General Election victories. I send my condolences to her family and friends.
Wonderful to join Finsbury Park Mosque for this evening's Iftar.  Worshippers who have been fasting during Ramadan invite friends of all faiths and none to share a meal at sunset.  Tonight’s gathering was huge, and I'm very proud to see my community celebrating its diversity. https://t.co/BK0EzKA40o

Today @AlexSobel led an important debate on Poland’s anti-defamation law.   The law could give licence to Holocaust denial, and the antisemitic abuse Alex has received further demonstrates its dangers.   Britain must urge the Polish Government to amend or repeal this law. https://t.co/9vlpmmVKFC
At the @FBUnational conference today, I thanked the heroes who went into Grenfell Tower, and regularly go above and beyond, to save lives.  Sadly, a year after that tragic fire the Government is still failing to listen to firefighters.  https://t.co/F2vNzjBSGH
Labour will ensure our public services are funded properly. And we will make sure all our public servants are given the resources, pay and conditions they need to deliver the services we all rely on. #FBU18 https://t.co/d6lKGWJPpr
The public are less safe from fires and other dangers than they were eight years ago, but also our firefighters are overworked and demoralised.  That is why the next Labour government will recruit 3,000 new firefighters and conduct a full review of staffing levels. #FBU18 https://t.co/c6blhVyDJL
Today, I was proud to speak at the Fire Brigades Union conference.  We have lost one in five frontline firefighting jobs and dozens of fire stations have closed since the Conservatives took office. #FBU18 https://t.co/BsfegNWskn

It was a pleasure to be at Al Manaar Mosque for yesterday's Iftar, the moment at the end of a day of fasting when people come together to share a meal.

My thoughts are with all those affected by the devastating eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano, and emergency service personnel who are working in some of the most difficult circumstances to try to save lives.

The Manchester, London Bridge and Finsbury Park attacks showed our communities will always stand together and refuse to be divided, even in the face of great tragedy. #LondonUnited https://t.co/3iRKI8ywEr
I was honoured to present a #PrideofBritain award to PC Wayne Marques who risked his life during the attack. I pay tribute to our emergency services who are first to respond to these horrific acts and put themselves on the line to keep us safe every day. https://t.co/bpb59UQi7N
Today our thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the eight people who died in the London Bridge terror attack.   Just as after the attacks in Manchester and Finsbury Park, our communities stood together and refused to be divided, even in the face of great tragedy.

Taxpayers saved RBS after bankers drove our economy off a cliff.   Instead of selling off our shares in RBS, the Government should use our stake to stop the closure of local bank branches that people rely on, cutting jobs and hitting rural communities.   https://t.co/VsFK2eqET5
I recently met with low paid workers in Scotland.   The next Labour government will introduce a £10 an hour real living wage, end zero hours contracts and improve rights at work.   Join the Labour Party and together we can build a society that works for the many, not the few. https://t.co/BPdk8OOgt8
Today marks 48 years since Labour introduced the Equal Pay Act. But in 2018, the scandal of unequal pay still persists.   The next Labour government will go further to ensure equal pay for equal work and require employers to take action to close their gender pay gaps. https://t.co/Kcaid2U1xw
Floods in parts of the Midlands this weekend demand action.   The Government must immediately reverse its cuts to flood defence programmes, and finally take action to tackle climate change by investing in renewable energy and transitioning to a low-carbon, high tech economy.
The Tories' plan to sell off RBS shares at a loss to the taxpayer is unacceptable.   We bailed out RBS. It should be run in the interest of the public, not for private profit, and used to invest in small businesses and local economies across the UK.  https://t.co/2pfBvB0zyl
Bank holidays are an opportunity to relax and spend time with family and friends.   The next Labour government will introduce four more, bringing us up to the average for the world’s biggest economies, to give British workers a well deserved break.
The @Conservatives must apologise for their failed privatisation and top down restructuring of our NHS, and record underfunding.  The next Labour government will scrap the disastrous Health and Social Care Act and give our NHS the funding it needs.    https://t.co/49Y1JvrltL
Andy Tsege, a British citizen and one of my constituents, has finally been pardoned after four years on death row in Ethiopia.   I hope Andy will be released from prison, brought home and reunited with his three children as soon as possible. https://t.co/EdYcQYTWjF
Great news that the Republic of Ireland has voted to #Repealthe8th to support a woman’s right to choose.   Congratulations to everyone who has taken part in this inspiring campaign and to everyone who travelled home to vote. A fantastic victory for women’s rights.
Yesterday I visited the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  The Tories’ reckless approach to Brexit risks dividing communities.  Labour will negotiate a new customs union to prevent a hard border to secure peace and prosperity. https://t.co/m6murZjvB3
This week marks 20 years since the Good Friday Agreement referendum.   Yesterday, I spoke at Queen’s University, Belfast, about the need to revive the spirit of the Agreement and prevent the return to a hard border, to protect peace and ensure prosperity for the many not the few. https://t.co/aCt4cOz2B9
The Thatcher government's Section 28 law was a grim moment in our country’s history.  Despite continuing Tory support, @UKLabour scrapped it in 2003. But we still have a long way to go. https://t.co/oun9WRQmw0
Fascinating to visit Lagan College, the first integrated school, bringing Catholic and Protestant students together.  Founded in 1981, it's now the most oversubscribed school in Northern Ireland. A great symbol of how communities can work together for the common good. https://t.co/rnfcRRZB1t
Let’s work together in the spirit of friendship and hope.  As Seamus Heaney once wrote:  History says, Don’t hope On this side of the grave, But then, once in a lifetime The longed-for tidal wave Of justice can rise up, And hope and history rhyme.
Tomorrow I will be visiting the border to talk to those communities who would be most affected by any change to the current arrangements.  Let's not give up years of hard fought stability for the pipe dream of race-to-the-bottom free trade deals with the likes of Donald Trump.
Political parties in Westminster must do more. I call on the UK Government to reconvene the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  We must find a creative solution that avoids a return to direct Westminster rule and lays the ground for further progress for all communities.
Labour is as committed to the Good Friday Agreement as ever.  It has served us for 20 years and will provide us with the framework for the next 20 and beyond.  We must do all we can to make power sharing work again in Stormont. We need all sides to come together.
The agreement was built on the back of the spirit of the men and women of these communities, no longer willing to tolerate pain and division.  We need that spirit again if we want 20 more years and beyond of peace and greater prosperity.
I’m in Northern Ireland and have just spoken about how 20 years ago, the vote by the people here and in the Republic to accept the Good Friday Agreement changed the course of history and opened the door to peace. https://t.co/nhIaeTaI5I
Thirty years ago today, Margaret Thatcher's Tory Government introduced the cruel and discriminatory Section 28.  The @Conservatives continued to support it, including @Theresa_May, until Labour scrapped it in 2003.  https://t.co/njBaAzHK0e

Moving and beautiful service in Manchester Cathedral this afternoon, to remember the 22 victims of the terror attack 12 months ago, and to support their families and the survivors. https://t.co/q7xGNnklD5
My thoughts are with the victim's family and those affected by last night's stabbing in Islington.  Thank you to the emergency services and everyone who helped, including St Mary's church that stayed open as a Council rest centre through the night to provide shelter and support.
A year since the Manchester Arena terror attack, we think of the 22 people who were killed, their loved ones, the injured and an entire city that came together in love and strength in the face of great tragedy. #ManchesterTogether
Not content with targeting migrants, @Theresa_May has created a hostile environment for homeless people.  Labour will end rough sleeping and build the homes people desperately need.  https://t.co/dWjWxW6L45
What makes our discussions about economic ideas important is our determination to make people’s lives better.  We have a fundamental belief in an economic system that works for the many, not the few. https://t.co/gyltXQlYuO
Our NHS mental health services must get the funding they so desperately need.  And we must continue to talk about mental health to break the stigma and tackle its causes by transforming the economy so it genuinely includes everybody and excludes nobody. #MHAW
Too many workers endure stress in toxic work environments or face job insecurity, with many more worried about debts, rent or mortgages, not knowing how they will make ends meet at the end of the month.
What makes these discussions important is our determination to make people’s lives better.  And as it's #MentalHealthAwarenessWeek, I talked about how a perfect storm of economic pressures is feeding a mental health epidemic that costs our economy almost £100 billion a year.
Today I spoke at @UKLabour’s #StateOfTheEconomy conference, bringing people together to discuss and develop our plans to transform our economy so it works for the many, not the few. https://t.co/7ooPkpOGtL
Congratulations @JanetDaby who has been selected as Labour's candidate in Lewisham East.  She has done an excellent job as Deputy Mayor and I know she will be a strong voice for the people of Lewisham East in Parliament. I look forward to campaigning with her in the by-election.
Join Labour today and work to end this rigged system: https://t.co/YrV3PplZMp https://t.co/BJcBvgKG3t
This is absolutely shocking. @Theresa_May's hostile environment continues to tear lives apart.  @SajidJavid, what happened to your promise to make things right?  https://t.co/2PSJgdwYHL
It is distressing to see waiting times for cancer patients soaring, with some having to wait a year or more to get treatment.  The Government's underfunding of our NHS is failing cancer patients.  https://t.co/UXK2dzfy2C

Today is International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia.   A day to recognise the progress made in the struggle for LGBT+ equality and recommit ourselves to working with the LGBT+ community to fight for full equality here in the UK and around the world. #IDAHOTB
I was delighted to attend the unveiling of the Millicent Fawcett statue in Parliament Square last month.  But 90% of the statues in London are of men. We must recognise Mary Wollstonecraft's immense contribution in the fight for gender equality.  https://t.co/e99j9GEY4n
Great to see a statue of Mary Wollstonecraft has finally been commissioned.  But the campaign still needs to raise lots of money to make it a reality.  Find out more and donate here https://t.co/vkYkiqPrYO https://t.co/1iNmVuChgb

The Tories have failed to build the council homes we desperately need.  The next Labour government will invest in the biggest council housebuilding programme in more than 30 years.  Well done @SadiqKhan for showing what can be done.  https://t.co/MAUAtCnCD5
The Government is in complete disarray on Brexit and its reckless approach is putting jobs at risk.  If @Theresa_May can't negotiate a good deal, she should step aside so that Labour can. #PMQs https://t.co/VRsSJ4CQ4u
Labour in government will treat people with dignity.  We'll end @Theresa_May's ‘hostile environment' that has ruined the lives of so many Windrush citizens, close Yarl's Wood and invest in services for survivors of trafficking and domestic violence.  https://t.co/RzmKmrpNl3
Thank you to my colleague @RichardBurgon for reading from my statement at the #Gaza demo outside Downing Street this evening.  https://t.co/qUDmcDe2xv
The responsibility for these wrongful deportations stops at @Theresa_May's door.  Apologies are not enough for the lives that have been ruined and the deep hurt and pain that communities have suffered.  https://t.co/GK24xEvMXH
The killing of dozens of unarmed protesters and wounding of many more by Israeli forces in Gaza, on the day President Trump moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, is an outrage that demands not just international condemnation, but action.  https://t.co/qUDmcDe2xv
Moved by touching tributes to Tessa Jowell in the Commons, to her warmth, compassion, and her bravery in using her illness to campaign for better cancer care.  She will be remembered as someone who gave her life to public service and campaigned to improve the lives of others.
This tells you everything you need to know about British politics.   The @Conservatives are bankrolled by the super rich. Labour's funding comes from thousands of small donations and trade union members.   We are building a people-powered movement to take on the rigged system. https://t.co/oQhnZ2Tr40
On Saturday, I spoke at @The_TUC rally about the trade union movement and our collective endeavour to achieve a more equal society. This demonstration was a declaration that we are around to campaign as long as it takes to bring about social justice and solidarity. #TUCnewdeal https://t.co/GkqEJu5vFQ
Yesterday, I was campaigning in Scotland against SNP and Conservative cuts and the devastating impact on jobs and local services. We are building a movement to elect a Labour government which will invest in our public services and transform our society for the many not the few. https://t.co/O8LQLC20lW
Great to see communities coming together to celebrate #Telford50, which is this year. The new town continues to thrive.  Growing up in Shropshire, I saw Telford's beginning and admire its rich history as the birthplace of industry and site of the world's first Iron Bridge. https://t.co/FgBpxtMmDB
Devastating to hear the news of Tessa Jowell's death. From Councillor to Cabinet Minister, her achievements were huge, including helping to bring the Olympics to London. Her strength in raising awareness of her illness and fighting for better treatment for others inspired us all
I’ve just been speaking at the @The_TUC rally  about why the next Labour government will bring about a fundamental shift in power in our country - from the few to the many. Watch the speeches live here: https://t.co/6mo6jV5sjq

From Plymouth to Glasgow and Belfast, we have a proud tradition of building some of the best ships in the world. But the @Conservatives are trashing that tradition.  We are calling on the Government to build these new ships at home and create thousands of jobs. https://t.co/YwZwak33VX
The @Conservatives are trashing our industries. Today I joined @GMB_union and @unitetheunion in Govan, Glasgow, to talk about Labour’s plans to protect UK shipbuilding and secure thousands of jobs. https://t.co/xM1sqF5L0y
The @Conservatives are giving a handout to a few grammar schools despite cuts to schools funding overall.  The Government should give all schools the funding they need rather than support a vanity project for the few. https://t.co/rIq5RasN9C
We have a proud tradition of shipbuilding in the UK. The @Conservatives are trashing this by offering this work to overseas companies.  Labour will keep this work here, securing thousands of jobs and supporting UK industries.  https://t.co/bp1fLRwq7m

We cannot allow Islamophobic smears and prejudice to divide our communities.  https://t.co/UmczlzXJvI
Today I asked @Theresa_May six times about our future customs arrangements with Europe.  Each time she failed to answer.  23 months after the EU referendum, this is not good enough. #PMQs https://t.co/GDGK2s6dQW
This decision tells you all you need to know about how the Tories treat working class people. Such injustice cannot continue.  https://t.co/Dx4kxlHKJ4
Time and again, the delivery of the Tories' cruel policies are outsourced to private companies, with devastating consequences.  https://t.co/lpoF75qkmb
Today I was delighted to meet Pedro Sánchez of @PSOE, and former Brazilian president, Dilma Rousseff.  We spoke about the way ahead for progressive and socialist politics in Europe and Latin America. https://t.co/l1WQREG7aP

In the local elections, we’ve built on the historic gains we made at last year’s General Election.  Now we must prepare for the next one. https://t.co/66MZaUDuKa
“Britain prides itself on being a leading democracy – but it is a dark day for politics when thousands of blameless people turn out to vote only to be refused."  This is the independent Electoral Reform Society's verdict on Tories' voter ID trial.  https://t.co/mVM1WW8VSR
Today is Firefighters Memorial Day, a day to remember those who lost their lives in the line of duty, and to honour those who continue to serve their communities. These incredible people keep us all safe, often putting themselves at great risk.
I was delighted to be in Plymouth this morning where Labour took control of the council from the Tories.  Plymouth now has a council that will stand up against Tory austerity and for equality and justice. https://t.co/idObPqfKIW
Labour achieved a solid set of results in the local elections.  We have consolidated and built on the advances we made at last year’s General Election, when we won the largest increase in Labour’s share of the vote since 1945.  https://t.co/wXOimJVzED https://t.co/QDcbsBXVaA

Today I've been meeting people from the Windrush generation. They’ve made an incredible contribution to this country.  With @AmberRuddHR's departure, @Theresa_May has lost her human shield.  The Prime Minister should end the “hostile environment” she created. https://t.co/9EnJyzUwP2

Yesterday @AmberRuddHR told Parliament the Home Office didn’t have deportation targets.  Today we discover they did and @Theresa_May knew.  They must take responsibility for the chaos they created and the huge distress they've caused to the Windrush generation. https://t.co/Jih8puBwct

The revelation @Theresa_May wanted to "toughen" the message on those hateful Go Home vans points to a nastiness at the heart of Government.  This is not what our country is about. The Prime Minister should apologise for authorising this ugly campaign.  https://t.co/l7pGzixJLx

A War Powers Act would enshrine in law that the government must seek parliamentary approval before deploying British troops in combat.  The British Prime Minister must be accountable to Parliament, not to the whims of the US President or any other government. https://t.co/sEojD2ih0v

Today, Labour is proposing the introduction of a War Powers Act.  There is no more serious issue than the life-and-death matters of military action.  The Prime Minister of Britain is accountable to Parliament, not to the whims of the US President or any other government. https://t.co/rT779bdTFX

Today, I responded to the Prime Minister's statement on the missile attacks on Syria.  Britain, acting through the United Nations, should now take a diplomatic lead to end this abhorrent conflict. https://t.co/zxhJe2u4j3
This morning I met Nana Akufo-Addo, President of Ghana, ahead of Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings.  We discussed the rights of Commonwealth citizens in the UK, trade after Brexit, reform of the Commonwealth and UN, the role of the African Union and US forces in Africa. https://t.co/53IdFei1ao
It's disgraceful that the rights of the Windrush Generation have been brought into question by this Government and that some have been wrongfully deported.  @Theresa_May must give them the rights they deserve and answer serious questions about how this has happened on her watch. https://t.co/CYbZBuzSv3

After @Theresa_May’s attack on Syria, I have called for a Wars Powers Act so that governments are held to account by Parliament for what they do in our name.  The Government must now, through the UN, take a diplomatic lead to negotiate a ceasefire in the Syrian conflict. #Marr https://t.co/rktvvNnUxI
Today, I was interviewed about @Theresa_May’s legally questionable attack on Syria. https://t.co/5jBJq2tPaq
Today, I’ve been in Calderdale in Yorkshire.  At the local elections on 3 May, we need to send a message to the Tories, who have devastated communities with relentless cuts.  That’s why we’re out campaigning. Together, we can build a country that works for the many, not the few. https://t.co/erPlatSQkt
Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have already been killed and millions displaced. The Government must take a diplomatic lead to negotiate a ceasefire in the conflict.
I have written to @Theresa_May in response to last night’s legally questionable air strikes on Syria.  Parliament should have been consulted and voted on the matter. The UK Prime Minister is accountable to Parliament, not to the whims of a US President. https://t.co/MWHxmoPbPZ

Earlier today I was interviewed about how further UK military intervention in Syria risks a dangerous escalation of the conflict. https://t.co/Z6bXWcTfAk
Further UK military intervention in Syria's appalling multi-sided war risks escalating an already devastating conflict.  My full statement: https://t.co/wWpxxk8eYI
Labour’s policy to give free bus travel to under-25s could save young people up to £1,000 a year. https://t.co/7aUkEd3iiV
Today the labour movement came together to remember and celebrate Rodney Bickerstaffe. He was an outstanding trade unionist, a great socialist and a committed internationalist as well as a warm and fun loving friend. https://t.co/pwJCiaLGS3
It is vital that parliament has the chance to debate and decide in advance on any government proposals to support a new US-led military intervention in Syria, which risks a dangerous escalation of the conflict.
Our free bus travel policy for under-25s has gone down well in Derby. https://t.co/hA8mnnKnmW
Today, we're proud to announce that the next Labour government will give under-25s across the country free bus travel.  Young people deserve a break and this could help up to 13 million under-25s save as much as £1,000 a year.  https://t.co/q18UOXXSlg
I'm so sad to hear of the death of Len Tingle. He was passionate about politics, Yorkshire and its people in equal measure. He's a huge loss to journalism and Yorkshire has lost a loud and proud voice. My thoughts and deepest condolences go out to his family.
I support #UniteforParkinsons with @ParkinsonsUK to spread awareness of this condition and the impact it has on 145,000 people in the UK and countless more across the world.  Please watch and share this powerful video:  https://t.co/328Qa4eNCV

Yesterday, I went to one of the communities that has been torn apart by violent crime.   We must listen to the experts who deal with these issues day-in and day-out and to those directly affected to make sure our communities are safe. https://t.co/3R0bxhAAMS
A deeply sad consequence of the failure of this Tory Government.  We're the fifth richest country in the world and we have the resources to house people, yet our Government chooses to maintain a broken system that only works for the wealthy elite.  https://t.co/RwpTmSjpRp
Today, I hosted a roundtable with experts and people directly affected by violent crime. These discussions will feed into the development of Labour’s policies to make our communities safer.  My full statement: https://t.co/xiuyoe0jKF https://t.co/BfVUV94auh

The Good Friday Agreement was a defining moment in Irish history which allowed peace to prevail.   My full statement here: https://t.co/9XCLTqOltB
Today @SadiqKhan and I launched Labour's London election campaign.  You simply can’t have security on the cheap.  We need Labour councillors elected on Thursday 3 May so we can protect Londoners from the Tories' reckless cuts.   https://t.co/1FcyZJZN9V
Despite @AmberRuddHR claiming police cuts have not contributed to the recent violence on our streets, a report by her own department says otherwise.  Labour in government will recruit 10,000 additional officers to tackle surging gun and knife crime.  https://t.co/0QLE8s9Nxf
The horrific deaths and injuries in Douma point to a chemical attack which must be fully investigated by the UN and those responsible held to account. The need to restart real negotiations for peace and a political settlement in Syria could not be more urgent.
.@Theresa_May and @AmberRuddHR are ignoring their record on security. They have cut 21,000 police officers from our streets. https://t.co/JbIkVCBerK
The killing and wounding of yet more unarmed Palestinian protesters yesterday by Israeli forces in Gaza is an outrage.  I have asked for this statement to be read at today's demonstration supporting the Palestinian people in Gaza: https://t.co/KzxZU83cIg
Communities are crying out for national leadership to tackle rise in violent crime but @Theresa_May and her Government are nowhere to be seen.  Labour MPs in London are calling on the Prime Minister to meet us to discuss how to make our communities safer.  https://t.co/7tqXl9GuQR
"Too many lives wasted. Too many families destroyed. It could and should be so different."  @LouHaigh writes on how Tory cuts to police, health, education and council services are failing our communities.  https://t.co/VZEk4C4e1h
Today it’s been reported that 1,000 Sure Start Centres have closed since 2010.  The @Conservatives have opted for tax cuts for a wealthy elite rather than fund children and young people’s services. https://t.co/ICXc7SLBe3
Sums up this Government.  Instead of taking action on air pollution that kills 40,000 people a year, the @Conservatives have spent over half a million pounds of taxpayers' money fighting three failed court cases.  https://t.co/cblks0bHjX
This Tory Government has utterly failed families across our country.  They have opted for tax cuts for a wealthy elite rather than fund children and young people’s services.  https://t.co/cLy9GvAP8s
When @Theresa_May became Prime Minister she said: “If you’re one of those families just managing...the Government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours.”   Nothing could be further from the truth.  https://t.co/CXyjdzM2eO
Ahead of the local elections, I've been out campaigning with @AngelaRayner and @TracyBrabin.  On 3 May, you can elect Labour councillors to protect your community from the worst of Tory austerity.  But we need you to campaign with us to make that happen: https://t.co/F2rhe3YNOC https://t.co/TWST1aQnDP
Today Labour launched our National Education Service consultation.  Like our country’s greatest institution, the NHS, our National Education Service will provide cradle-to-grave learning for all, free at the point of use.   Help us develop our NES plans: https://t.co/m2FYTzp7Ch
In exactly one month, on Thursday 3 May, you will be able to elect Labour councillors and mayors who will protect your community from the worst of Tory cuts.  But we need you to campaign with us so we can win: https://t.co/F2rhe3HcX4
On #WorldAutismAwarenessDay please watch @Autism's powerful film about what many autistic people experience when faced with unexpected changes.  One in 100 people are on the autism spectrum. Let's use today to learn more about how we can best support people with autism. https://t.co/tVxAV6RwH8

I would like to wish Christians in our country and around the world a happy #Easter. https://t.co/nUL65Nh8NL
This is very welcome and wonderful news. A simple piece of dignity for bereaved families.  Huge credit to @CarolynHarris24 and the Sunday Mirror who tirelessly kept up the pressure when the Government was dragging its feet.  https://t.co/WBb2SOAbbI
The killing and wounding by Israeli forces of civilians demonstrating for Palestinian rights in Gaza is appalling.  The UK Government must make its voice heard on the urgency of a genuine settlement for peace and justice.
Under this Tory Government housebuilding has fallen to its lowest level since the 1920s. But despite this, Labour councils, like in Milton Keynes, are using their powers to build the homes our communities need. https://t.co/JnzY5em561
As Jews across our country start to prepare for #Passover, I would like to wish everyone in the Jewish community a Chag Sameach. https://t.co/vUmxnJHWGw
The takeover of GKN must be stopped. This is about people's jobs, national security and our whole industrial strategy.  Labour is calling on @GregClarkMP to step in and act in the national interest, instead of serving the interests of city speculators.
What a wonderful letter from @MayorofGM to Manchester's firefighters. Labour will always stand shoulder to shoulder with our emergency workers, who put themselves in harm's way to keep us safe. https://t.co/q6Ew4uBuj3
.@Theresa_May has overseen the loss of 20,000 police officers from our streets as Home Secretary and as Prime Minister.  You cannot protect communities on the cheap.  Labour will recruit 10,000 police officers and give our forces the resources they need.  https://t.co/vASFHM5HhT
You know things are bad when the Daily Mail calls out a rigged economic system.  The Tories have put the interests of city speculators over people's jobs.  Labour would have stopped the takeover of GKN and in government we'll make our economy work for the many, not the few. https://t.co/J8U7rmK9BI
Yesterday Google announced its UK tax bill will be just £50 million despite nearly £6 billion of sales in our country.  As our public services are being slashed, the Tories are letting an elite few get away with not paying their fair share.  We're not broke, we're being robbed.
Today I was interviewed by @JewishNewsUK.  Antisemitism is a cancer in our society which has surfaced in our party, Britain and Europe in recent years.  Seeing the hurt in the Jewish community makes me determined to challenge antisemitism at every stage.  https://t.co/6O98HODhnz
Today I asked @Theresa_May if she will commit to ring-fencing NHS mental health budgets to support those who need our support. #PMQs https://t.co/dx7t7KgDT4
I have written to the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Leadership Council. I will never be anything other than a militant opponent of antisemitism. In this fight, I am an ally and always will be. https://t.co/QhQnFEpplU
Labour is an anti-racist party and I utterly condemn antisemitism, which is why as leader of the Labour Party I want to be clear that I will not tolerate any form of antisemitism that exists in and around our movement.  https://t.co/HmkbdJ5sis
Yesterday, we got started with our people powered mass meetings - where people from all backgrounds come together to share their stories and commit to campaign.   We’ve only got five weeks to go until the local elections. We need you to join our campaign now. https://t.co/KtW9H9aBS8
Well done to @CarolynHarris24 who has tirelessly led this campaign and is forcing the Government to act.   No parent who has gone through the heartbreaking experience of losing a child should be left struggling to cover the cost of a funeral.  https://t.co/M21zlO7ydb
It's shocking that @Theresa_May has refused to intervene in this case that I raised last week at #PMQs.  Mr Thompson has lived and worked in this country for 44 years but is being denied cancer treatment.  https://t.co/sbL0G5xolt
At #PMQs I was pleased to wish a happy Newroz to those in the Middle East and all around the world. https://t.co/VuxJA2E5Dl
Yesterday Labour launched our local elections campaign.  On Thursday 3 May you will have the chance to send an unmistakable message to this Conservative Government that enough is enough.  https://t.co/DYjNwxRbh5
Our elderly are neglected for lack of social care. Decent people who have contributed all their lives are not being given the dignity in retirement they deserve.  It doesn’t have to be like this. Labour in government would do things very differently. https://t.co/hcNRNNEpso
On Thursday 3 May you can send this Tory Government a message to say enough of cuts to our police force.  There are 20,000 fewer police on our streets since 2010 and today the police inspectorate is warning that 999 calls are sometimes not responded to for days. https://t.co/pY2tkOwIyb
The country’s housing crisis is deepening. It’s a crisis that has left 120,000 children in temporary accommodation without a home to call their own. That’s up two-thirds since 2010.  Labour will build the homes people need and ensure developers build genuinely affordable housing. https://t.co/6840lNnl9Z
Over the last eight years, the Tories have cut councils’ budgets in half.  In that same time, the Tories have slashed corporation tax, cut the bank levy, abolished the top tax rate on high earners and cut capital gains tax for the very richest.  Austerity is a political choice. https://t.co/KDcqkbjKUV
In the local elections on Thursday 3 May you will be able to send a message to this Government to say: enough of cuts to vital services that hurt local communities, enough of cuts to schools, hospitals and local policing. https://t.co/qFnjobjM4I
Today we launched our local elections campaign in Trafford.  On Thursday 3 May you will have the chance to send an unmistakable message to this Conservative Government that enough is enough. https://t.co/P6AQxqkokz
Today we remember PC Keith Palmer and all those murdered and injured in the Westminster attack one year ago. Hate filled terror will not divide us nor deter us from building a world based on peace and human rights.
This Conservative Government has slashed public services and expects local councils to pick up the pieces. #PMQs https://t.co/tatNSvKB5X
Congratulations to Jennie Formby, the new General Secretary of our party. Her talent, experience and commitment will play a crucial role in building on last year's General Election result, helping to lead @UKLabour into government to transform society for the many not the few.
We need Labour run councils across our country, like the one in North Ayrshire that protects its community from austerity. https://t.co/BBC5Y5BpJH
In Scotland, we were told that Labour was dying but in 2017 you elected six new Scottish Labour MPs and we came close to winning around 20 more. Working together, we can win back Scotland at the next General Election. https://t.co/0fShodq6vA
Last year, thousands of members helped us to create our election manifesto 'For the Many, Not the Few', which gained the support of millions of voters.  Now Labour members can help us build on those policies and prepare for the next election: https://t.co/an7P6kJff2 https://t.co/PJAAfhe3xe
In this powerful article @MattZarb explains how he was addicted to Fixed Odds Betting Terminals and why the stake should be cut to £2, as Labour pledged in our manifesto.  I know Matt and I know how committed he is to this.  https://t.co/wr3Ut25ecO
People's lives have been devastated because of Fixed Odds Betting Terminals. The @Conservatives can still act and prevent much of the harm FOBTs cause by reducing it to £2 a spin, as Labour pledged in our manifesto. https://t.co/Fk97fwO2Z1
On 3 May we need to elect Labour councillors and mayors across the country who will protect communities from the worst of Tory austerity.  But we can only do this if we get active - so come out to campaign with me and other Labour supporters this Saturday: https://t.co/DfGjI4Et1V https://t.co/5BDFGDfInO
Healthcare is a human right. The government must intervene immediately in this case to ensure that Mr Thompson gets the care he needs.  https://t.co/fvLeSdTCSu
We need Labour-led councils, like in Carlisle, across the country. Labour councils will protect communities from the worst of austerity which last week’s Spring Statement showed the Tories have no plans to abandon. https://t.co/eFtsswgi8E
As part of an effective response to the Salisbury attack, the Government should introduce an Oligarch Levy and other measures to tackle corruption and stop the flow of dirty money into the UK.  https://t.co/8oBu7DP2tK
Neo-liberalism is an ideology that ruins communities and ruins lives. It's an ideology that this Government is still absolutely wedded to as they continue to wreak havoc with their incessant cuts. #LabNorth18 https://t.co/YAG3xsDITf
Today I am supporting the #FamiliesTogether Bill to change the unfair Home Office rules which prevent refugee children bringing their close family members to join them in the same way an adult can.  Labour respects the right to a family life. https://t.co/Zh5BGQoOOL
On Tuesday, the Chancellor Philip Hammond delivered a #SpringStatement which ignored the crisis that eight years of austerity has created in our economy. You cannot cut your way to prosperity. https://t.co/zb5pqa8BJ6
The use of nerve agents on our streets is barbaric and beyond reckless.  The Russian authorities must be held to account. And the Government must do more to tackle the oligarchs and their ill-gotten cash. https://t.co/zp2a4u62FE
Today, university staff take their 13th day of strike action to defend their pensions. Our education staff deserve security in retirement. I urge @UniversitiesUK to return for fresh negotiations with @UCU to end this dispute and avoid further disruption to students.

Today, I asked @Theresa_May whether she agrees that NHS funding is inadequate. #PMQs https://t.co/ErOkTAIwK4
The attack in Salisbury was an appalling act of violence, which we condemn in the strongest terms.  The Russian authorities must be held to account on the basis of the evidence and our response must be both decisive and proportionate.  https://t.co/yaI3fXbAAu
Another indictment of the Tories' failed economic project.  This report predicts 1.5 million more children will be forced into poverty by 2022, and shows that disabled people and single parents are bearing the brunt of the Tories’ spending cuts. Shameful.  https://t.co/VqsQNxABKf
Stephen Hawking inspired the world with his determination to explain the mysteries of the cosmos. But he also showed breathtaking courage to overcome life's adversities and a burning passion to protect our National Health Service. He will be greatly missed.
The Tories have just been forced to delay closing the childcare vouchers scheme for at least six months due to pressure from Labour, led by @AngelaRayner.   It's clear @Theresa_May has neither a majority nor a mandate for abolishing childcare vouchers.  https://t.co/66eMh6JUlj
The Tories and the DUP have just voted through cuts to free school meals in England.  The Tories bought the DUP's support by excluding Northern Ireland from these cuts.  A disgraceful tactic which is playing politics with the health of our children.  https://t.co/3PhbHl0iB2
The disgusting hate-filled letters and packages sent to Muslim fellow citizens and colleagues in Parliament are utterly contemptible. My full statement here: https://t.co/VNTIrC1hey

Tories want to make it harder for people to vote.  At the local elections in May voters in five areas will be turned away if they don't have official identification and the Tories want to roll this out at the next General Election.  Sign here to stop them: https://t.co/IFwhQ32evc

Last month, academics from Loughborough University estimated that over 40% of children here in Birmingham are growing up in households in poverty. This Tory Government should be ashamed by this shocking figure. #WMLab18

Since the Tories trebled tuition fees, university bosses’ pay packets have soared, while staff are fighting for their pensions and students are saddled with £50k+ debt.   Labour will introduce 20:1 pay ratios in universities and scrap tuition fees to end this scandal. https://t.co/329fjgt3TG

Further evidence that @Theresa_May's reshuffle was nothing more than a hollow PR stunt.  @Jon_Trickett has written to the Prime Minister to ask her to apologise.  https://t.co/BSaJu85DxU
The @Conservatives' tax cuts for the super-rich and big business are being paid for by longer waiting lists, ambulance delays, staff shortages and cuts to social care. #PMQs https://t.co/ohhRHRmSHO
Today Labour is telling the Government it must release extra funding to tackle the appalling NHS winter crisis and reinstate delayed operations.  https://t.co/QmpyQfecev
Nurses and other healthworkers are being priced out of homes built on former NHS land.  Labour will give public servants the pay rises they deserve and end the Tory housing crisis.  https://t.co/7IRvlfpO4V
This weak and struggling Tory Government is causing untold damage and we need to replace it as soon as is possible.  https://t.co/xoqjh44g56
We will help people campaign where they live and work on issues that matter to them.  By organising with communities, we can build support for Labour to win and make real differences to people’s lives, even while in opposition.  https://t.co/RMiILZfonc
This should not be happening in our country.  https://t.co/7sTKcu070B
"We're all people. We're not just an object on the side of the road."  Tory councillors in Windsor and Maidenhead, @Theresa_May's local council, need to watch this and reverse their disgraceful decision.  https://t.co/UjSQU5xd2T
The elite fund the Tories because they maintain the rigged economy which serves them.  The average donation to Labour in the general election was just £22 because we will build a country that works for the many, not the few.   https://t.co/P4ixeahDSL
It is not good enough for @Theresa_May to say NHS problems are "frustrating" and "disappointing" when the Tory Government has caused this crisis.   Nurses, doctors and patients are pleading with her to properly fund our health service, but she is ignoring them.  #NHSWinterCrisis
These shocking inequalities in our society must end. The next Labour government will roll out maximum pay ratios, introduce a Real Living Wage of £10/hour and strengthen trade union rights so workers can fight for better pay and conditions. #FatCatThursday https://t.co/KVfANU33vZ
Congratulations to McDonald's workers and @BFAWU1 for winning pay rises but the fight for £10 an hour is not over. We achieve more together than we can alone, which is why we should all join a trade union.
Doctors, nurses, NHS staff and @UKLabour have been warning @Theresa_May and @Jeremy_Hunt that if they do not act we face another winter crisis in our NHS.  Patients and those who work in our NHS deserve better than this failed Tory Government. #NHSCrisis https://t.co/7mnWsH0tX1

The death of Iuliana Tudos in Finsbury Park on Christmas eve was shocking and tragic. I'd like to thank the police and her friends for their work and all those who have donated to support her family, raising £16k so far. Impressive community spirit in such tragic circumstances.

Thank you to @manchesterfire for their heroic work bringing the blaze in Manchester's Northern Quarter under control, and to the swift response of @gmpolice and paramedics.
In 2017, young people voted in the highest numbers for a generation. They were determined to shape our country and our politics for the better.  We had a chance to build on that by lowering the voting age to 16 years old, but in November the Tories cynically sabotaged it. https://t.co/dVHSGdK4rX

More than three million low-paid workers could be £5,000 worse off by 2020 under the Tories' so-called National Living Wage.  Britain needs a pay rise. The next Labour government will introduce a Real Living Wage of £10 an hour by 2020.   https://t.co/AuD2XT7jF9

Next week’s Budget marks an opportunity to break with the Tories’ damaging record and embark on a new path which provides opportunity for the many not the few. #AoCConf
In the 21st century the economies that will succeed are those that invest in people. This Government has cut school budgets and college funding and saddled students with a lifetime of debt. #AoCConf
Labour’s National Education Service will be based on the recognition that education is a universal benefit for the whole of society as well as the individual. #AoCConf
Just as Nye Bevan and Attlee's Government created the National Health Service in the aftermath of World War II, the next Labour Government will create a National Education Service. We will offer cradle to the grave education that is free at the point of use. #AoCConf
@AoC_info Due to seven years of Tory mismanagement and cuts, education in the UK is in a perilous state. Funding has been cut year on year, the attainment gap is widening and the curriculum has narrowed as courses have been cut. #AoCConf
