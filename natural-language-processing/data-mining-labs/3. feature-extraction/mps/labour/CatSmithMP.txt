Great news that the Government has (this time...) backed up the decision taken by our local council to say no to fracking at Roseacre #Fracking   Next, we need to ban this reckless rush for fracking and seriously invest in renewables.  https://t.co/8wPhS4M3PN
@Christies_Blvd Absolutely not endorsed by me nor the Labour Party.
@CherishOtoo So glad that there are people like you doing good where this MP makes things harder. Best of luck in Kenya and thank you for the work you‚Äôre doing on FGM.
@CherishOtoo It‚Äôs not the first time he‚Äôs blocked a bill that protects women, last time it was upskirting, now FGM. Shocking that Theresa May gave him a knighthood last year, she should make amends by stripping him of the Tory whip. The man‚Äôs an embarrassment to the Tories and the country.
Well if I do have to leave Lancashire to go to Parliament, at least I can take a butter pie and an Eccles cake with me in my @BBCLancashire tote bag? #Lancashire https://t.co/7VYI3si5Ci
Great to be out with fantastic Fleetwood Labour councillors &amp; campaigners! I enjoyed many positive conversations with local residents, where the most frequently raised issue was the state of the roads and pavements, which I‚Äôll be taking up with the Tory controlled County Council. https://t.co/D9UnJI0CVg
Congratulations Chris! https://t.co/bCFvf7lyEj
@kendrick_fowler Yes, it is an event for constituents only.
Thank you @BoardofDeputies and @APPGBritishJews for the work you do. As we approach #HolocaustMemorialDay on 27th January #WeRemember all those murdered and pledge to challenge antisemitism, hatred and bigotry in all its forms. https://t.co/8jehG42flI
I‚Äôve signed the @HolocaustUK book of commitment. The Holocaust did not start with the gas chambers but with hate filled words. We all have a duty to challenge antisemitism, prejudice and bigotry in all its forms. #WeRemember #HolocaustMemorialDay https://t.co/SW2CkwxbGv
So excited to get a letter from @CAupdates letting me know @thefleece_inn in Dolphinholme is a finalist in the Countryside Alliance Awards. It‚Äôs such a great pub and I love taking visiting friends and family there so very much best of luck to this gem of a pub! https://t.co/r3IuoerD0F
@CretanRunner Sorry? Have you misread my tweet? I‚Äôm at a local event remembering the six million victims of the Holocaust. An event I committed to attend months ago. I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôve misunderstood something because the alternative is just chilling.
@BunnyMegan7 I‚Äôve received emails from constituents affected by ME who are asking me to attend a debate (no vote) in Westminster on Thursday afternoon. Normally I would, however I‚Äôve committed to attend a Holocaust Memorial Day event in the constituency that evening and I can‚Äôt do both, sorry
@LizziCollinge @ryelandsps Glad you had a good time Lizzi, one of the best things about being a local MP is these school visits. Our young people never fail to inspire me - even at primary school age they care about the world they live in.
I‚Äôve just spoken about young people‚Äôs mental health in the debate on Further Education currently taking place in Westminster Hall. Having met with @b_and_fc and @LMCollege last week I know FE colleges do far more than just educate, they‚Äôre on the mental health front line too.
Turn your #bluemonday2019 into a #BrewMonday! I‚Äôve been volunteering this morning speaking to rail users at Lancaster station.

Not my usual Sunday morning radio interview; I‚Äôve been on @BBCLancashire discussing prayers which happen before the House of Commons sits every day. Do prayers have a place in a modern Parliament? There‚Äôs cross party support for abolishing them: https://t.co/MhZ8hR3wQx
@greenekingcares Thank you. Yes it is.
Hi @greeneking - disappointing that having tried 3 highchairs at the Barrow Hungry Horse, all have broken / missing safety straps. Would expect potentially dangerous items to be removed immediately, especially so at a family friendly venue.
Ahead of tonight‚Äôs vote I want to share why I can‚Äôt support Theresa May‚Äôs deal.   My constituents have been divided between Leave and Remain, but the Prime Minister‚Äôs proposals have united almost everyone in opposition to what is clearly a botched and damaging deal. https://t.co/lD2wue01NW
We need a proxy voting system for heavily pregnant MPs, and new mums/dads. When I was full term with my baby in June I was medically advised not to travel from Lancashire to Westminster for votes but, if there had have been an option to cast votes remotely I would have done. https://t.co/dz3XrTle6n
I share Gordon‚Äôs concerns and when it comes to seeking half a billion pounds of public spending this needs ALL Fylde coast MPs working TOGETHER. https://t.co/Rst3FYMp2d
@LizziCollinge @_erica_lewis @EdenMorecambe Just one of the many (so often behind the scenes!) meetings I‚Äôm having about HS2 and transport links throughout my constituency.
@skyatlantic Thanks for taking action. By chance I‚Äôve just walked past and it‚Äôs still parked like that - but with a Penalty Charge Notice from the local council!
Several constituents have raised this @skyatlantic van parked on a busy drop kerb. Wheelchair users, prams and guide dog users all stepping out into Moor Gate in Lancaster. https://t.co/tOW0FDymCz
Next time a London based person sounds surprised I live in Lancaster I‚Äôll send them a link to this.  https://t.co/svVlOzzD1J #Lancaster
I‚Äôve added my name to @jeremycorbyn motion of no confidence in the Prime Minister. Her avoiding having the vote on her deal is weak and she should go. Last week a third of her MPs said they had no confidence in her, this week all MPs will get their chance.
I love singing carols and tonight was the first chance I‚Äôve had this year, supporting @SJHospice. I have to say though the school choir from Bolton-le-Sands Primary School stole the show, fantastic singing! https://t.co/fxYpAMeOSq

It takes just a few minutes to register to vote online. https://t.co/Q6PfA1Yixz why not check your friends and family are registered as we never know when they‚Äôll appreciate using their right to vote.
Lancashire fracking halted after 1.5 magnitude tremor. The Government cannot block their ears any longer to community voices and climate scientists. They must act in the public interest and follow Labour's call to ban fracking immediately. https://t.co/0RQSFmvXhS
@richardtwine https://t.co/g7A1wi5Efz plus I‚Äôve given longer comment to Lancaster Guardian
The verdict on #Stanstead15 is  disappointing, seeing non-violent protestors prosecuted for defending the Refugee Convention, and are treated like terrorists is so sad. I‚Äôm pleased a Labour Government will review the statute book to better guarantee the right to peaceful dissent.

Have you considered doing a reverse advent calendar this year? Instead of opening 24 doors and eating 24 chocolates, you can donate to the food banks each day of advent. I nipped into @Tesco today and donated 24 items to their collection point in all stores this weekend. https://t.co/fcDcwLjrez
@Emmabarnett @bbc5live So much I can relate to here. Even though MPs don‚Äôt get mat leave and I was emailing from my hospital bed... let‚Äôs be more honest and say it‚Äôs ok to admit babies can be repetitive, relentless and you don‚Äôt get much back for months. Also, sleep deprivation is torture.
@realoz77 Sorry I can‚Äôt see all the tweets I get, that‚Äôs why I ask constituents to email me on my bio so everyone gets a reply and I can manage my work.   I will be voting on the 11th, but I won‚Äôt be supporting the PM‚Äôs deal. Happy to respond more fully on email if you have further q‚Äôs.
It‚Äôs always great to meet with groups of constituents who share knowledge with me, that‚Äôs why today I‚Äôve been with a group of local farmers coordinated by the @NFUPolitical to hear from them. I have huge respect for farmers who work hard to ensure we have food to eat. https://t.co/8koHo1177q
Having said that, it is not appropriate or sustainable for the practice of low wage or no wage staff or interns to be used in newsrooms up and down the country.
But loss of local papers is also cutting off a vital access point for the next generation of working class journalists to break through into this career. And all our journalism will be poorer for it.
With 200 fewer local newspapers than in 2005 it is bad news for local democracy and accountability. Local titles follow events affecting us all where we live, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to support papers like @GuardianDigital @FleetwoodWeekly @The_Visitor @The_Gazette @leponline
It‚Äôs v distressing to hear of developments at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. I understand the hospital is co-operating fully with police &amp; they have set up a helpline. I would urge anyone with concerns to contact the helpline straight away. I will continue to monitor developments.
@Tom_Mullen Constituency office phones are on, can you call again?
@northernassist No, you don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve had constituents contacting me about their experiences and this just doesn‚Äôt happen. If you need more information after travellers submit their evidence you need to tell them what you need from them. Also don‚Äôt lose their tickets when they send them in.
Well done all the Fleetwood Festive Lights Committee volunteers who work hard all year round to ensure we have an great display. They give their time so generously to see the joy on the kids‚Äô faces. I‚Äôm proud to support such a good community cause &amp; really enjoyed last night. https://t.co/5IOslKNGGK
Not many Scout groups have facilities like this amazing new Base Camp for the groups in Carnforth. As an ambassador for @LonsdaleScouts I got to cut the ribbon with Jack and Zoe. I feel very special to be supporting amazing volunteers in our area who deliver Scouting. https://t.co/xHX5n8afFA

Still think fracking is a good idea because the industry keeps telling us it‚Äôs safe? Please watch this 7 min piece from @Channel4News which aired last night.   Spoiler: the Dutch ditched fracking because ordinary people don‚Äôt like their homes collapsing.  https://t.co/h4lmhNCHjS

Yet not one of Lancashire‚Äôs Conservative MPs was able to join me at 7am this morning to defend the cuts to policing that they‚Äôve all voted for.  If you vote for cuts at least defend why you did!
I‚Äôve spoken to @BBCLancashire this morning about the huge cuts to policing. You can‚Äôt keep people safe on the cheap, with the 21,000 police officers cut since 2010 cuts will have consequences. Locally the reorganisation of community policing is a direct result of these cuts.
@shazkhala @jeremycorbyn @CarolineLucas Labour manifesto commitment to ban fracking so that‚Äôs every Labour candidate come the next election
There is a debate in Parliament tomorrow about #fracking and following yesterday‚Äôs earth tremor - the third that‚Äôs been serious enough to stop fracking in recent days - I‚Äôve written to the government ahead of it calling on them to act now and stop fracking here in Lancashire https://t.co/Y4DjiJHVrE
@NorthernPontoon I‚Äôd like to visit very much. Perhaps we can arrange over email? cat.smith.mp@parliament.uk
@DeaconPaulC @CarrieMaisie Can‚Äôt guarantee I‚Äôll see them! Trying to type whilst feeding a wriggling baby
@DeaconPaulC @CarrieMaisie Sorry I must have missed your tweet Paul. With a new baby and sometimes hundreds of tweets a day I can guarantee I‚Äôll see them that‚Äôs why I say to email me in my bio. Also helps to be able to respond more fully. Look forward to your email!
9 days since fracking started in Lancashire we‚Äôve had 17 earth tremors. It‚Äôs like the earth is trying to tell us something...  Elsewhere in my constituency a solar farm on a reservoir shows innovative ways of locating renewables in communities.   My blog: https://t.co/Vs8h0Noq6f

After seeing today‚Äôs front page of @FleetwoodWeekly I‚Äôve written to @wyrecouncil urging them not to stop giving out sandbags. I know for many these sandbags protect their homes &amp; businesses. If you live in Wyre write to your local councillors to urge them to keep the sandbags. https://t.co/Cyb7vJ1jzN
Team Labour hearing from local residents all year round. https://t.co/AqHSaA4Spl
These tremors are a warning of more serious implications ahead. It‚Äôs incomprehensible that the Tories refuse to embrace renewables.  Labour has placed the future of our planet at the heart of our long term policies, and would ban fracking. https://t.co/b2hb0Vjd79

@HobartRuth @HouseHistorian1 @mikegalsworthy Also, I‚Äôd only block a constituent on security advice, never their political views. Remember, I campaigned for and voted to remain in 2016 when we had the referendum.

@NineBelowClaret It‚Äôs shocking. Have you emailed me about this? I‚Äôm raising the issue with various authorities and keeping constituents who‚Äôve emailed me up to date with my actions on it.

@einsteinanono There‚Äôs a private nursery that I could use but only from 3 months, my baby isn‚Äôt that old yet and actually I‚Äôm really enjoying bonding with him. There wasn‚Äôt a vote.
So pleased to see Westminster Hall packed with MPs for the #fracking debate.  If I wasn‚Äôt sat at home watching it whilst nursing my baby I‚Äôd have been there and making the case that local communities like mine have rejected it and want a frack free future for our children.
Thanks @GwynneMP for taking up this week‚Äôs media interviews on the boundary changes whilst I‚Äôm on maternity leave from Westminster. But with the Government now dragging their feet over when the vote on them will be, perhaps I‚Äôll be back at Westminster when the time comes?? https://t.co/bIOHGe8C8r
@mbrendansweeney Neat idea! Sorry I‚Äôm not going to see you at the Conference this year as baby Eli is still to young to be put into the cr√®che so we will be watching it all from home. First time I‚Äôve not been since 2006 I think!

NEW JOB: Join my team working in my constituency office: https://t.co/ajiexyPcuu I‚Äôm recruiting for a caseworker to join my busy office and support the work I do as MP for Lancaster and Fleetwood.
@ADGFleetwood No problem. Being a parent is hard work but rewarding!
@ADGFleetwood I‚Äôm not able to Andy as this is running through the summer recess and I have a newborn who needs feeding 8-12 times a day! üë∂üèª but I‚Äôve been meeting with local officers and finding out their experiences as an alternative to this great scheme. Hopefully it runs next year.
Issues raised by my constituents in Wray today prove that Tory-controlled Lancashire County Council is letting communities down right across our county. It‚Äôs obvious that the cuts from the Tory Government in Westminster are hurting rural communities as well as urban ones. https://t.co/UJvi4qDkL2

Awful news for Fleetwood that the MoJ has decided to close the family court. Along with many others I raised objections to moving cases to Blackpool with all the related issues of transport and leaving our town with an empty building in a prominent place. https://t.co/3N5tpklxSd
@LizziCollinge Actually Eli was in his pyjamas, all he wears is sleepsuits so he didn‚Äôt really have a choice!
@TomRozwaha Perhaps not this time, although it‚Äôs an important debate and I‚Äôm sure many of my colleagues will be taking part. I‚Äôll be at home with my week old baby looking after my own perinatal mental health this time!
Thank you to all the brilliant staff at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary who brought him into the world safely. Thank you @BenSoffa for being a great support throughout the journey. @UHMBTMATERNITY @UHMBT
Absolutely thrilled to welcome Elijah (know as Eli) to the family. We're now all back home and settling in to all of life's new challenges. He's a bit longer and heavier than we'd imagined from the bump (3.6kg / 8lbs) but we're loving every last bit of him. https://t.co/sD7MhqnLfI
@JWoodcockMP Well said John, Lancaster is lovely if you live here but no one should be left stranded here. The state of Northern.
@richardmarcj Actually I had similar issues on the train between Lancaster and Preston I‚Äôm sorry to say. I think a lot of it is people not paying attention and looking at their phones.

@WestEndImpact @LancashireCC It was so powerful to hear the testimonies, I‚Äôve taken away a renewed sense of commitment to fight poverty.
Listen to young people and you‚Äôll hear what they want. I‚Äôve been listening and heard their call for better political education, and the right to vote.   As politicians we often make decisions affecting 16 &amp; 17 year olds - time we gave them the vote.  https://t.co/VEvd1wbLUY

@FranMCampion @UHMBT @pauljebb1 Hi Fran, I would support the bill on Friday but I‚Äôm still waiting for my June baby to arrive - it‚Äôs late! But I know many of my colleagues will be there to support it.
Labour strongly supports the Armed Forces Covenant by which this country promises that those who have served - and their families - are treated fairly. Whether it‚Äôs healthcare, housing or pay, we must do more to ensure that our duty to you matches your service to us. https://t.co/MMEw7QrjPe
@Emma4facs Oh Emma, that sounds terrifying there aren‚Äôt the words... thinking of you and your little one x
@EstherHorner1 @UHMBTMATERNITY You too!
Although the baby can stay put for the next 90 minutes.... kick off!
Another positive experience with @UHMBTMATERNITY I‚Äôve got to say I‚Äôve been so impressed with the care received from everyone. Hopefully it won‚Äôt be long until they help deliver my baby because being 9 months pregnant in the heatwave is too much! ‚òÄÔ∏è
So many families come to my advice surgeries in housing need, and despite there being 118,162 more people on council housing lists in the North than in the South we get just 15% of new Government funds. https://t.co/3aZboUHUU3
@Seaofchangefilm Happy to support this but a physical meeting might not be possible for a while as I‚Äôm about to have a baby.
This is tonight, please support if you can! https://t.co/UVOktI8Loe
@DrAkhtar I won‚Äôt be in afriad, I hope to be having a baby! Or even better have had it.
@sophhkennedy I expect bump will be baby! You‚Äôre very much welcome for cuddles with baby x
@sophhkennedy I was going to invite you both round to hear about your plans once the baby was born but you‚Äôll have it all sorted by tomorrow I reckon!
@janebinnion @lowcarbon_ged I specifically asked the Rail Minister about the economic impact assessment on the Northern Chaos. He didn‚Äôt say he would do one! I‚Äôll be keeping pushing him (and pushing a baby out at the same time probably!)
@GwynneMP @Booktrust @TamesideCouncil I hope ‚ÄúFun Uncle Andrew‚Äù picked up some books for Baby Smith given I couldn‚Äôt make it #toopregnant !!
@janebinnion Also, Northern are on strike today so there are fewer trains than normal. Anyway, hope your Virgin train arrives in the next 10 minutes or so and you have a safe journey to London.
@janebinnion Hi Jane, the delay on your train is probably either the trespasser on the line outside Lancaster earlier, or there could be a problem with the freight train in front of the one you‚Äôre hoping to catch.  But in this occasion I don‚Äôt think Northern deserve any of the blame!
@here2supportall Thanks for letting me know Graeme, if you come across any examples so it‚Äôs not just rumour can you let me know? If they‚Äôre constituents I can also take up their case too.
The chaotic Tories at County Hall can‚Äôt even use correct procedures to privatise our public services!  How much will their attempt to contract out children‚Äôs health services to Virgin Care cost the taxpayers of Lancashire in legal fees?  https://t.co/H3s2BevyeL

@Gav39908512 @GranadaReports The couple are @timfarron constituents but I‚Äôve approached both local councils and Trust for solutions to this problem. I‚Äôm continuing working on this.

@Yorkie71 @GrahamJones_MP @LancashireCC Hi Martyn, like my Labour colleague I‚Äôm also pushing the Council on this. I wrote to them on 5th June highlighting my concerns and I‚Äôm waiting to hear back.
@LancashireCC Hi Lancashire County Council, we are fast approaching three months since I reported that pothole. It‚Äôs still there, it‚Äôs a little deeper and a little more dangerous. I‚Äôve shown it to the County Councillor @LizziCollinge who is shocked by it too. Any update on it getting fixed?
@gwcollinge Thanks Winston, baby gave me quite a scare yesterday but my due date is just days away so we will just be glad when they have safety arrived now.
Thank you NHS for being there when we need it. For me that was an unexpected hospital trip yesterday. I‚Äôve been advised not to travel so won‚Äôt be able to reach Westminster to vote today. I appreciate the Government pairing me with a Tory MP so it won‚Äôt change the result of votes.
Phew! That was a stressful 90 minutes. #ENGTUN #WorldCup
@Edge_Cycleworks @PoliceLancaster @LancsPoliceRBLX @LancasterCC @ragtimecyclist @LancasterUni @LancasterSU This needs nipping in the bud, it‚Äôs reckless beyond words!
@BBCLancashire @NFBUK @GrahamLiver This is welcome, so many of my constituents won‚Äôt travel to shop in Preston of Blackpool because of these shared spaces. It‚Äôs a nightmare for blind and partially sighted people.  But can we also address street furniture/ advertising boards etc too. It‚Äôs a real issue.
Took my amazing Dad out for tea last night to wish him a happy Father‚Äôs Day. I was born on Father‚Äôs Day but sadly (despite being 9 months pregnant, what can I say? I tried.) I didn‚Äôt give him a grandchild yesterday. https://t.co/hGtL66WLci
The Tories shamefully claimed voter ID was "a great success" despite hundreds being denied the right to vote.  This is misleading. If it had been used in last year's general election, it could have affected the outcome in nine seats.  My @TheTimes article: https://t.co/79wS1EGgDh

For me it‚Äôs my constituents who miss out but for other businesses they‚Äôd be hit hard financially with all those consequences too.
Last Tues @bt_uk fault meant we lost all phone &amp; internet to constituency office. I‚Äôve just been told they haven‚Äôt actually started fixing the fault! Furious doesn‚Äôt come close!

@NishmaHindocha @BBCLancashire @Gillylancs Good luck Nish!
@RogerJ_01 @BBCNWT It seems they can‚Äôt run a PR operation any more than they can run a rail service!
@LancashireCC Thank you for this update. I have taken the County Councillor for the pothole, @LizziCollinge to see it and she agrees with me it‚Äôs quite a problem and understands why local residents are so unhappy.
Just spoken to @GrahamLiver on @BBCLancashire about #NorthernFail and we heard from Paul who was trying to get to work in Barrow by 9am from Lancaster but all trains have been cancelled that will get him there on time.  Time for Northern to be stripped of this contract.
@toddles23 @TPExpressTrains This is outrageous!! Come on @TPExpressTrains this is the sixth time in two weeks Zara has been left on a train because booked assistance hasn‚Äôt turned up!

@Funny_Bird86 @GrahamLiver @northernassist @BBCLancashire That‚Äôs fine, no problem. Include your address which helps me keep track of everyone‚Äôs cases? Thanks
@Funny_Bird86 @GrahamLiver @northernassist @BBCLancashire Thanks Vikki, if you email me any feedback I‚Äôm writing to Northern with every issue that‚Äôs raised with me. That way it‚Äôs easier to keep track of paper trails.

@corpsybride86 @EMTrains Shocking. And to think that these train companies argue that running trains in the private sector gives a better service than it would if it were to be publicly owned under a Labour government....
.@EMTrains booked seats on your 1742 Manchester Pic to Nottingham train purposely as I‚Äôm very heavily pregnant and can‚Äôt stand. Creates a real problem when the reservation labels aren‚Äôt put out as now there are others sat in my seat. (Kindly someone else offered me seat)
Congratulations to all the local Labour candidates selected tonight to stand in 2019. It‚Äôs probably the right time to say thank you to all who are retiring at the next election too.

And then to top it off, Bradford wasn‚Äôt even in the trial area but was asking voters for ID and was turning actual voters away. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôve apologised but we must assume some of those voters never returned to cast their ballots which raises serious questions.
That will be more legitimate voters denied in just 5 councils than cases of fraud across the whole of the UK last year.   This trial was a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
1.67% of all voters across the five pilot areas were unable to vote because they did not have the required ID to vote.
So we have come to the end of the first polling day when some voters in trial areas were asked to show ID to vote.   Across the five councils voters were refused a ballot paper in 21% of polling stations.
For our public services ‚úì For our communities ‚úì For the many not the few ‚úì  This is why millions of people are voting Labour in the local elections this Thursday.  If you're one of them ‚Äì share this ‚Üì #VoteLabour  https://t.co/LuBFh4wgVU

The response from the Government regarding their plans to pilot voter ID is clearly inadequate. We cannot allow this Government to pilot discriminatory measures that could disenfranchise legitimate voters who already face multiple barriers to democratic engagement. https://t.co/EntA2lk4Rt

Great to see @JulieForBurnley raising the appalling situation in Tory-controlled Lancashire of pot holes. One of the biggest local issues. No answer from the PM. #pmqs
Our common sense Brexit deal: put jobs, the economy and most importantly ‚Äì our country ‚Äì first. Agree? Pass this on ‚Üì #PMQs https://t.co/hTOlcDxso6
Thank you for the presentation and I‚Äôm looking forward to visiting Lancaster Deaf Club soon to learn even more. Thank you for your time, I‚Äôve already spoken to two other Lancashire MPs who couldn‚Äôt make it about what you told me. https://t.co/R1EbElqokd
@deafwayorg Thank you so much for your presentation today, it‚Äôs shocking and important that we take steps to fix accessibility for all our residents in Lancashire.
@LancasterGirls Wow, they all look stunning!
I‚Äôm astounded at the abuse and threats against me and my family I‚Äôve received in recent hours because of an incorrect assumption I oppose medical use of cannabis. I don‚Äôt blame people for not understanding obscure Commons rules, but you don‚Äôt help your cause by abusing people
Some people have been mis-informed about what Parliament was ever likely to debate yesterday. My scrutiny of the Overseas Electors Bill was due to real concerns over election fraud &amp; had nothing to do with the medical use of cannabis - something I support https://t.co/ujkU52SYdK
I‚Äôm proud of Lancaster Uni &amp; Uni of Cumbria in my constituency, both great universities because of hard work of their staff, many of whom are on strike today defending their pensions. Needless attacks on their conditions will only end up damaging the HE sector which is so vital.
@CABFleetwood @CitizensAdvice I‚Äôm trying to get along to this!
Disappointed to see this, have you reported the potholes again? Your councillor @_erica_lewis will be very interested to support you in this too. https://t.co/1kLU8QrPp2
With the announcement over the loss of Sunday service to Knott End I know my constituents will be very pleased to see this Andy! https://t.co/PEU4QzvDkd
@PenrhosPete @FleetwoodWeekly That‚Äôs why my column in this weeks paper will update residents on my meeting with the rail minister in the past few days.
@Richardthebaldy If you email me (see my profile) I‚Äôd love to set up a visit.
Despite correcting a journalist last night, disappointing to see national paper run a story they know to be untrue. All my staff earn more than ¬£10 an hour and I‚Äôve always advertised in line with IPSA payscales which MPs have to do. Complaint to follow.
@PenrhosPete @FleetwoodWeekly But Pete, Labour didn‚Äôt win the election and we aren‚Äôt the government despite how hard I campaigned!
Less than a month ago the local Conservatives were pushing leaflets through doors in the Preesall by-election saying the ferry had been saved by them. Premature boasting before this was actually confirmed? Some might say electioneering? Poor show. This needs sorting. https://t.co/PqORyMbB60
The Tories are marking 100 years of votes for (some) women by trying to block people from exercising their right to vote @DawnHFoster   https://t.co/f1vJILeCW8
Theresa May has been in charge of policing for eight years ‚Äì and look at her record. Violent crime on the up, and 21,000 police officers axed. Share the facts ‚Üì #PMQs https://t.co/FZC6AGgdaw
You don‚Äôt just see the local Labour Party at election times, really good to be out with local councillors and members to hear from residents about their concerns this afternoon. https://t.co/YkyPw36UtC
Congratulations @Chris4BNC Labour‚Äôs candidate for my neighbouring seat of Blackpool North and Cleveleys at the next general election. Bring it on!
The Tories‚Äô hypocrisy knows no bounds. They claim that 16 and 17 year olds lack ‚Äúsufficient maturity and responsibility‚Äù for voting rights, but apparently are perfectly suited to pick the next Conservative leader.   https://t.co/jgP3UcA806
today I hosted a roundtable discussion with my colleague @Marshadecordova and disability charities discussing barriers to voting faced by disabled people. Thanks for all the helpful contributions, the next Labour government wants democracy accessible for the many, not the few. https://t.co/VxhDeEhHmx
@PPChoir Oh I am sorry to say I wasn‚Äôt (I hadn‚Äôt known about it) it‚Äôs my loss I‚Äôm sure. Did the performance go well?
I should clarify, it‚Äôs just more usual to meet constituents in Lancashire! But happy to meet in Westminster when constituents are down here.
Absolutely delighted to meet Shel today in the House of Commons talking about infant feeding. I‚Äôve had loads of meetings today but meetings with constituents in Westminster are usual and therefore very special! https://t.co/gAjaIY52Ox
Last year we saw the highest youth turnout at a General Election since 1992. We know that young people are incredibly politically engaged and asking for the right to vote at 16. A Labour government will make it a reality. https://t.co/kTUPTE1Kaq
@VLlobera Ah I‚Äôm sorry to see your photo and I know that train too, it‚Äôs a frequent issue. I‚Äôve raised it before but happy to do so again. Ultimately we need investment, in the NORTH as well as the south.
BREAKING: The Welsh Labour Government (@WelshLabour) has announced that the voting age will be extended to 16 for local elections! First Scotland, now Wales ‚Äì it‚Äôs time the whole UK introduced #Votesat16 https://t.co/8F4VxzrvLQ
@geraintsays It‚Äôs abolished. Plans to start an annual meeting open to the public but no minutes kept and no votes.
@LancasterUni @LancasterSU @TheSugarhouse Usually either the Carleton or Sugarhouse back then!
@JMThought Abolished, we will be having an Annual Public Meeting (all details TBC) from now on with no votes or notes taken.
@LancasterUni @LancasterSU @CllrLAtkinson @nathanneilburns It‚Äôs also nice to be back in the lecture theatre that I was in at 9am every Thursday morning as a first year undergraduate! I‚Äôm sure I made all those classes after the Wednesday night activities....
This morning I was at the 54th (and last ever) meeting of the Court at Lancaster University. I have concerns about the reforms but I‚Äôll always work with the Uni in a constructive way to see it‚Äôs growing success, but also that the whole community has a stake in it. https://t.co/kYDJ85pNET
@LUSUComms Thanks!! Look forward to hearing more sisters speaking now
@warriner68 Oh no! Sorry to hear that, hope she‚Äôs ok.
Great turn out from local Labour Party members who have turned out tonight to hear from @JonAshworth Labour‚Äôs Health Secretary https://t.co/zZ1ADxnOJu
@phil_woodford @JonAshworth @UHMBT Thank you for facilitating the visit Phil, have a great weekend.
Thank you for coming to see our local hardworking NHS staff here at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary. https://t.co/s7MJaw8wJJ
Thanks @LuneTube! Lancaster‚Äôs MP these days has a much more humble abode and really doesn‚Äôt share this MP‚Äôs views on the slave trade üò± thanks for your fascinating videos into our city‚Äôs history. https://t.co/vb20dR7q1J
@MoreMusic1 @LancasterCC @LancCastle I spoke about the power of words for good and for evil reflecting that my child will grow up in a close-knit Jewish Community here in Lancaster. I know older generations will share the words of Holocaust survivors so they know what they know what happened too.
‚ÄúThe power of words‚Äù is the theme of this year‚Äôs #HolocaustMemorialDay. Tonight in Lancaster we lit candles in memory of all those murdered before using the power of words in music and poetry to commit to standing up against persecution, discrimination and prejudice. https://t.co/I7Nphapj1l
@LabourList Those of us from the area know that @LizziCollinge won because she was the best candidate for the job! Disappointing to see outsiders trying to play politics with this...
@mrwtch @Scarletpolitic1 I‚Äôm surprised to see my photo here.... last time I checked I wasn‚Äôt backing any candidate for Young Labour!
@LabourStudents This is disappointing. As I understand, every one of the current officers was elected on a platform of delivering OMOV.  Terms of office being extended by weeks is a weak excuse for voting against the change your members wanted.  I‚Äôm happy to work with you to see OMOV happen.
@UKLabour @LizziCollinge An excellent choice by our members, Lizzi will be taking the fight to the Tory MP there and showing the people of Morecambe and Lunesdale what a great difference a Labour government would make to their lives. Well done Lizzi and the CLP for voting for her!
@_erica_lewis @LizziCollinge I‚Äôm so proud of both of you and proud to call you both my friend. I‚Äôm also so proud at the way you both conducted yourselves and that is because you‚Äôre both lovely people. It must have been a difficult choice for the party members tonight!
@gwcollinge That‚Äôs the loveliest tweet I‚Äôve seen all day.
Congratulations @LizziCollinge I‚Äôm looking forward to supporting you and making sure Morecambe and Lunesdale gets the Labour MP it needs and deserves. https://t.co/05ZoFmN7si
@RedCampaigner1 Welcome! So pleased to have you on team Labour!
Great to be in Carlisle today supporting our fantastic candidate @ruthalcroft #labourdoorstep #SaveOurNHS https://t.co/1tj97GhyEX
@davebax1974 @LizziCollinge If you want me to look into it it‚Äôs easiest if you can put this in an email to me so I can see the background - Cat.smith.mp@parliament.uk
@AndyCreer Hi Andy, if I‚Äôm your MP I‚Äôm happy to chase this for you tomorrow. Obviously don‚Äôt put your address on here but email Cat.smith.mp@parliament.uk
@LabourNorthWest @KimSnape Congratulations Kim! Looking forward to campaigning alongside you.
@Yasmine_Dar @UKLabour Congratulations Yasmine!
@jonlansman @UKLabour Congratulations Jon!
Brilliant to see @samaritans at Lancaster station this morning encouraging commuters to take time for a cuppa on #BrewMonday. I‚Äôll be taking mine down to Westminster where I‚Äôll be taking some time to chat over a cuppa with my hardworking team and colleagues. https://t.co/IdjA7sS3vJ
@LGBTLabour @LGBTLabourNW @IanDylanThomas @sarkerton @heatherisone @LGBTLabourWales @LGBTLabourEM @LGBTLabourSW @stephanielloyd1 @crispeater @walker_astrid Absolutely.
@TheModernScipio Haha, but I always get a fist bump when I‚Äôm buying books in Waterstones...
It‚Äôs been a pleasure to serve as shadow minister for local transport in @AndyMcDonaldMP‚Äôs team since the general election but it‚Äôs also a pleasure to pass the baton to @MattRodda MP who is passionate about this policy area. #reshuffle #labour
Well done Labour‚Äòs Nic Fogg who increased our vote 14% in Wyre Rural Central tonight on Lancashire County Council. Huge increase in support since May 17 elections. The seat has always been Conservative and will continue to be for now, but Labour is gaining rural support.
@newOne97 If you‚Äôre a constituent having difficulty can you ring the office tomorrow afternoon? I‚Äôm in advice surgery all morning.
@kshackleton1 @finnerty_cat Thank you Karen, that‚Äôs really lovely of you to say so. And it‚Äôs cliche I know but I‚Äôm always happy to help.
Today‚Äôs the day! Vote for Change. Vote for Nic Fogg. If you want a councillor who cares, who opposes gas storage and who lives in Preesall - vote Labour. https://t.co/VtreL6ZbeZ
@StevieWise @Robbiie__ @nusuk @votesat16 @LabourStudents Looking after all my constituents including your mum! üôÇ

Excellent performance by Cod Army! Many thought we‚Äôd be battered but instead we fight another day. A credit to the town! #FACup #FTFC #Fleetwood

A million children in poverty will miss out on free school meals under Universal Credit proposals. Take action today https://t.co/afTQ41aMTl
@mountainecology The sensible first option would be to contact your Lancashire County Councillor as that‚Äôs the body responsible but if you have any issues doing that I‚Äôd be happy to help.
Congratulations Dame @JackieDanielNHS - it‚Äôs good to see recognition for NHS staff in the honours list!
I agree with Councillor Collinge, please can LCC request an alternate route as a priority as the estate has many depending on that bus service. https://t.co/QGX0qpXESt
@LancashireCC I am still waiting for a call back today so we can discuss. But separately from that.... Stagecoach aren‚Äôt running busses onto the Newton Estate they say Council need to request alternative route. Can you update me as to if you have or if you plan to?
@Yorkie71 @LancashireCC @TheBayOfficial This answers my question and then raises more, like why our highways authority does not own materials and machinery to fix roads? I‚Äôve left a message with a council officer to call me back... https://t.co/BGRQA52OK0
@LancashireCC Thanks, but that doesn‚Äôt answer my question.
@LancashireCC Can you confirm that you are not planning to undertake this work immediately? Given this is the main road into Lancaster from the M6, this surely must be an urgent priority.
@LancashireCC when will Caton Road in Lancaster be reopened after yesterday‚Äôs accident? I understand there has been a diesel spillage so resurfacing works need to happen.
Older people are less likely to have passports and photo driving licences which would be required in trial areas this May, with up to 10,000 impacted.  https://t.co/BqtzCCpB6W

Lovely to see @samaritans singing Christmas carols in @StNicsArcades #talktous they‚Äôre here for all us us this season
@Barkercartoons Well that doesn‚Äôt feel at all stalkerish Gary.... you could at least have said hello! üòÜ
@GrahamLiver Shocking and upsetting.
@Chris_Altree @JWoodcockMP Absolutely would believe you!

@PenrhosPete @JWoodcockMP But Pete I‚Äôm now over an hour late for work because it broke down, so although they‚Äôre great classic locos I‚Äôm going to knock them today if that‚Äôs ok... missed a meeting about local health services because of it. ‚òπÔ∏è
@JWoodcockMP Typical luck. Now it‚Äôs broken down in front of the London train so I‚Äôm not going anywhere fast....
Here‚Äôs this morning‚Äôs ‚ÄúNorthern Powerhouse‚Äù service into Preston just leaving Lancaster.... it wakes @JWoodcockMP ‚Äòs constituents up at 4am as they warm up the loco in sidings at Barrow. They break down a lot. They‚Äôre not accessible either. https://t.co/dgz3G9p8MY
Always a pleasure to begin my Monday morning speaking with @GrahamLiver on @BBCLancashire. Not so nice to discuss sexual harassment in the workplace... know your rights, join and union and make sure your employer has a policy that‚Äôs enforced.
@ADGFleetwood @jeremycorbyn Andy, if I could introduce you to local homeless you‚Äôd see they are paying in. They‚Äôre working but homeless and in temporary accommodation/ B&amp;Bs often with kids too. Homelessness problem is more than rough sleeping.
@woollyhatpoems Ah I‚Äôve just joined up your twitter name and your real life name in my head! It was lovely to see you and I‚Äôm so sorry about your books. That must be really upsetting as a book lover.
Thanks Holly, residents at a public meeting tonight would echo your call on the government. https://t.co/2qcbCDX8Zj
@jasoneden Sorry your dad isn‚Äôt well but agree wholeheartedly with what you say about our amazing NHS.
You can donate to food banks at Tesco this weekend. Simon and James helped me fill two baskets in their Fleetwood store today which I‚Äôve donated as a ‚Äúreverse advent calendar‚Äù. Instead of a chocolate a day, 24 items to the food bank. https://t.co/wwDpWdF4QN

@LancashireCC Delighted that since this tweet I‚Äôve had a flurry of replies from Lancashire County Council Highways team. Mostly with the opening line ‚Äúthank you for your email from August 2017‚Äù.... constituents I am getting answers now!

@GwynneMP Cheer up, you‚Äôre on your way to the county town of the greatest county days before Lancashire Day!
@woollyhatpoems @LancasterCC Sorry about your home Woolly Poet. It is the County Council who will be cleaning drains etc but if you email me a query I‚Äôll put it to them. That way is possible for me to keep a paper trail for records. Thanks.

Just spoke to @ElecNW_News engineer on the ground in Hala (Lancaster) who is trying to do controlled electricity shutdown to avoid substation blowing.
@KathrynSabanLaw @LancashireCC Thanks for update. I‚Äôve passed this on to police.
On the 4th October I wrote to @LancashireCC expressing concerns over blocked drains and was promised a reply within six weeks. That‚Äôs passed and I‚Äôve heard nothing and observe drains blocked throughout Lancaster and Fleetwood. I‚Äôm angry tonight.
I‚Äôm back in Lancs now and it‚Äôs heartbreaking to see homes flooding. Don‚Äôt drive through flood water and stay tuned to @BBCLancashire radio for a special show with weather updates. @LancasterCC have enacted emergency response and @wyrecouncil have sandbags. Follow them for more

@AndyBounds I have it emailed to me.
Outraged government has overridden Lancashire and granted permission for fracking at Preston New Road site. Affront to local democracy
If the Government overturn Lancashire's fracking decision they'll have lost any she'd of credibility on their localism agenda.
In Lancashire we are waiting for the government's decision on fracking. But Lancashire County Council already made our frack free decision

I've just asked Govt how fracking wells will help tourism on Fylde Coast (they won't!) and it's clear they have no answers #DCLGquestions
Good to see @SarahChampionMP raise the crisis in domestic violence refuge places hitting specialist services. Govt cuts hurt DV victims

@lucieanncarter thanks for taking event down, it's fair u know I informed ur Department &amp; Vice Chancellor when u were still defending it
@lucieanncarter @jeremycorbyn take the event down now. It's deception, a breach of ethics and taking up my time.
@lucieanncarter @jeremycorbyn no Lucie, it's not. I don't appreciate having to spend time having to deal with this &amp; neither do party staff
@warren_ellie the event is a hoax, it isn't happening. The person who put it up is going to take it down. So she tells me.
@Tom_Clark7 the event is a hoax and I'm assured the person who put it up will be deleting it.
@CathHill2 hi Cath I've spoken to the person who put the event up. It was never happening and she's going to delete the event now.
@CathHill2 it's very strange given there's a major political event in Parliament tomorrow.
@CathHill2 @jeremycorbyn I believe it's the Queen's Speech tomorrow which should answer that query!
So pleased @TheBayOfficial getting deserved recognition at #Arqivas for work they did in the floods; a radio station part of the community

@jembendell hello!
@mgbarrowclough fair enough, my staff certainly don't have to wear ties. Especially on hot days!
Every now and then it's fun to wear high heels. Until you get blisters, sore feet, fall over and injure yourself. Not to mention posture...
And she's right! No one should be made to wear things that make them feel uncomfortable at work.  https://t.co/a22fUa2QuT

@Yorkie71 @Clive4LancsPCC similar, not simple.
@Yorkie71 @Clive4LancsPCC elections like Ldn Mayor have booklets all candidates can submit to which go out. We need simple for PCCs.
@Yorkie71 @Clive4LancsPCC unlike gen election, PCC candidates can't have a mailshot to all households, they have electorate of millions.
David Cameron is presiding over a crisis in adult social care. But he really doesn't want to talk about this very real issue #PMQs
Someone should point out to David Cameron that #PMQs is where he answers the questions - he doesn't ask them.
Lancaster voters can't vote Tory in tomorrow's Lancashire County Council by-election; because the Tories aren't standing a candidate!! #PMQs

@GreenAyreRises thankfully not, although I have won back prizes donated to raffles before!
@GreenAyreRises @friendslanclib hats off to all of you.
Excited to hear I won a prize in the @SJHospice raffle this weekend! Makes up for spending most of the bank holiday in bed with a virus.
@critchyboy do they allow gin at synod?! #badmethodist ;-)
@critchyboy so it is. I'm all confused with bank holidays! Fleetwood singers next Saturday. Too busy a social life!!
@critchyboy thanks Paul, still under the weather but hoping to be in top shape for Saturday's Christian Aid Quiz Night if that's still on?
@fleetwoodbeach ooh you can all be on the telly, must find out what he's filming so we can watch. @FleetwoodWeekly can u find out what's on?

@ekirogers you'll be great Erica, you don't need luck but good luck anyway!
@GreenAyreRises thanks, hope to try again tomorrow to see all the bits I didn't have time for today at risk of fainting. ü§ï
@holwoll no, I visit Wyre Council who are Tory controlled and that doesn't mean I support Tories. Just means I'm engaging with constituents.
@holwoll I support all the schools in my constituency and have visited almost all of them now, that's what a good MP does.
@annaturley you have beautiful fingers Anna, you're just in too much of a hurry with other more important things than Twitter ;-)
@sirtobybelch_ exactly like that. Should I assume this was given to me by a sharing constituent? Shaking hands is like biological warfare!!
@vickybeeching thanks Vicky, I'm trying to. Hope your bank holiday involves fewer boxes of tissues than mine has :-(
Managed to spend a few min at @GreenAyreRises before stumbling back to bed. I have lost my bank holiday to a virus. https://t.co/tK6dl5JGHP

@Danielxander clam down, "diversity" means small village schools, larger urban schools, CofE/Catholic schools,  etc in my constituency...
Real issues for schools: funding cuts, oversized classes &amp; a teacher recruitment / retention crisis. That's why JC has PM on the ropes #PMQs
PM wrong on academies - power will be centralised with the Secretary of State in Whitehall - snatched away from local councils #PMQs
Jeremy Corbyn is right to push issue of forced academies. Govt "one size fits all" approach doesn't recognise diversity of schools #PMQs
PM in a difficult situation on forced academies - very quiet on his benches as backbench Tories know its a bad idea. #PMQs
Good luck to the pupils at @LancasterGirls with #UKAYRoC tomorrow - sending rockets up and hopefully launching careers in science too!

@AnnaMcCarthy92 @Abortion_Rights because no MPs who have been called by the speaker have raised it.
@iashy @LancashireCC @Andrew4Pendle they're all gone by next budget. All spent on delivering core services.
Excellent #PMQs from @JennyChapman - women's refuges are threatened by closure from this government actions. Cuts cost lives.
By this time next year Lancashire County Council will have to set a budget using the last of their reserves - there will be no money left!
Shame on Andrew Stephenson MP for accusing @LancashireCC of cutting women's refuges when it's HIS govt who have slashed the council budget!

@MikeatLancaster it's been a while since I came down to the Giant Axe so I'm due a visit - good idea.
Thanks for inviting me along! I've had a great night.  https://t.co/elNbLf3F9z
@Chris_Altree I can't "like" your tweet but *pats shoulder* there there
Check score at 90 min, we've won. Check score after 5 min extra time, we've lost. Oh #BarrowAFC... 3 points lost in 5 minutes?! :-(
@thebigredkeith @GregBroadhurst @respphysio @mndcampaigns @mndassoc received 3 emails about it from other constituents so I got the msg. :)
@thebigredkeith @GregBroadhurst @respphysio @mndcampaigns @mndassoc but I will be there attending event
@thebigredkeith @GregBroadhurst @respphysio @mndcampaigns @mndassoc Keith, just checked my emails and not received anything from you sorry
I'm in important debate on changes to women born in 1950s' pensions now - demanding transitional arrangements for these women #WASPI
In the Commons I've asked the government about legal framework for protection of national parks from surface drilling for #fracking
If you've been flooded and you'd turned on #PMQs now I imagine you'd be furious at behaviour on Tory benches.
David Cameron is avoiding legitimate questions about why his government has cut flood defence spending - flood victims aren't laughing #PMQs
Despite staying voting on Housing Bill until 2am, I'm in Westminster Hall hoping to speak in debate on Palestinian child prisoners.
@UoCDramaLancs @CumbriaUni @TheDukesTheatre email me the details? I'd love that.
Wanted to go to the cinema tonight to see The Danish Girl. Change of plans as I head to the BBC Newsnight studio...

My thoughts - and other newly elected Labour MPs - on what 2016 holds for the Party. Unite and fight this government https://t.co/9T8XgHwdcI
@dpsalmon t'was a pleasure Dave, I'll have to call into the studio at some time too!
This is surely going to be one of the highlights of 2016 for me. I'm taking my Dad to see this!  https://t.co/X89d1N7iQ6
@TawnyOwlEmma @LonsdaleScouts scary and upsetting. I hope they get caught and the Scouts gets their equipment back.
@TawnyOwlEmma oh that's awful Emma, I hadn't heard. Was it insured?
Government needs to pull its finger out and pledge help. Also ¬£60m for the whole North of England really isn't much. https://t.co/jnchy8rgfK
@Eru_Rouraito thanks for doing what you do with cafe Harry. Can't make tomorrow but hope to see u at next one!
Cuts to terrorist response vehicles been made in secret - there should be scrutiny of these shortsighted decisions  https://t.co/2RiAjQxe8n
It's devastating to see Northern England flooded again - government must stop cutting flood defences &amp; protect our communities and economy
Thank you to all of your officers who are once again being fantastic in adverse weather.  https://t.co/24jEzBlLF3
Just spoken to Graham on @BBCLancashire - thoughts with all flooded today, it must be particularly devastating this time of year.

@frackfreemps I'm up in the North West today so won't be able to visit.
@AndyJSykes I voted against government motion to bomb. It won't make for a secure Syria and too many q's left unanswered by Cameron on plan
When I voted against government plan on #SyriaVote tonight I did so with a huge majority of Labour MPs and majority of shadow cabinet
@TheBayOfficial for your story I voted against bombing.
I do not believe air strikes will make for a secure Syria or make us safer here which is why I voted against the government plan #Syria
@JFDIecologist is like to but I can't as have another commitment I can't rearrange following death in custody.

@knittipolitti not volunteers, I'll be able to say more soon but a wealthy source and large land owner might give you a clue!
@knittipolitti its devastating to see scale of these cuts. I'm asking for meetings with local organisations who I hope might plug this gap

It's Friday night, and whilst my friends are at the pub I'm sober and on my way to do #Newsnight life as an MP eh.
@PenrhosPete @Corbyn4Leader of course - that it's for women to decide and debate (like he suggested)
@Ajayy77 other plans for the bank holiday!
@JUSTMYSAY i don't know sorry but these things often end up on YouTube soon after
Finally I get to go to a #Corbyn4Leader rally this weekend! Excited to be introducing @Corbyn4Leader in Manchester http://t.co/1u8faqoIrD
@fyldeonfracking @unitedutilities actually Mark Menzies (Fylde) and Lindsey Hoyle (Chorley) were in the meeting with me. Update on  Fb ASAP
@johnstez have spoken to them and I can't get any more answers than are publicly available so can't tell you anything new. We need answers!
It's been TWO WEEKS since 300,000 homes in Lancashire haven't been able to drink tap water. My constituents increasingly getting frustrated.
@PenrhosPete haha no! But my phone keeps tricking me. Autocorrect fail.
@frackfreemps I was giving you a good news tweet - you sounded like you might need one!
@north_sapientia @Corbyn4Leader yes and proud to be
@frackfreemps how about my local paper interview where I'm backing @Corbyn4Leader and opposing fracking! http://t.co/PMiSMjPlbb
@eastcj phew! Looking forward to it
@eastcj tennis club yes, but wasn't aware of an invite to a cricket club this weekend...

My first trip out with Will and John on an under 10s fishing boat at Fleetwood. http://t.co/dHVFhCPFN8
@GranadaFishBar an excellent fish and chips for me and @BarryGardiner - we enjoyed it!
@Neurodropin my office did get in contact to arrange a visit but I was told you weren't there on the day I visited the Farms. Try again?
@BeestonNicola so I am! That tweet certainly sent my account into meltdown - my most re-tweeted yet!
@MrJoshBooth @OwenJones84 you're both so vain ;-)
@CancerCareLocal would love to! Let's arrange over email. Can you drop me a line? http://t.co/Z02WOVjkqZ @ parliament.uk
Gordon Brown called for a leader who gives us hope, is credible, radical and electable - on which basis I'm backing Jeremy Corbyn
@unitedutilities @jaspne @grmusicpix thanks for the update. Do you know when you might expect to be able to say more?
@leponline the main problem is they seem to be breaking down a lot. I've been made aware of multiple journeys being delayed or cancelled.
@grmusicpix @jaspne over to @unitedutilities to answer that
@grmusicpix @jaspne I'm not an expert on our water works but it's a big system and its going to take a while to "flush out".
@jaspne @unitedutilities they have found the source of the crypto and now just need to flush it out. It will take some days.
Good to see you Craig! https://t.co/aKdoQcyNWX
Just called in to @unitedutilities next to YMCA in Fleetwood and it's good to hear they've found the source crypto. http://t.co/GmbpUE6Dfu
@ScaleSilver49 you're welcome. Goodnight
@ScaleSilver49 the decision made by our members who are voting - who ever is elected there should be no coup. Respect democracy.
@ScaleSilver49 I'm not a fighter Adam, and yes I'm backing Jeremy.
@ScaleSilver49 whoops you've some catching up to do its not 2007 anymore... see http://t.co/ZEEC5CU15g ;)
@ScaleSilver49 if you look on theyworkforyou website you'll see I've already been asking about the ivory trade.

@blumagoodude @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour I'd be happy! I nominated Jeremy and am campaigning for him.
@TuttonR looking forward to it!
@IanBFAWU great to catch up Ian, really pleased to be working with BFAWU #hungryforjustice
@BeestonNicola if you've signed up as a member or supporter you'll get email from our local secretary James Groves?
@RobbiePGPickles @jeremycorbyn he was in Preston at the weekend but he knows there's always an open invite to Lancaster
@andrewwaugh you and me both! It's an issue and if I find a local NHS dentist I'll register too. It's on my list.
@virt_lancaster Tory cuts made nationally and local councils forced to make the real tough decisions.
@StubCrouch funding from central government is being cut year after year.
Osborne's selling of RBS shares at ¬£1bn loss today - but in the long term far greater loss not to have a bank the state can use for growth.
Lancashire County Council will be announcing they have to make ¬£223m cuts between now at 2020. Be clear, these are Tory Government cuts.
@sarah_fielden @leponline these are national government cuts passed down to local councils for them to make the real difficult decisions.
@paulwilkinson08 my vote is = to all Labour Party members and supporters, are you registered or a member?
Excellent paper from @Corbyn4Leader about the North of England http://t.co/BwYACpqodS funding cuts to the arts will hurt Lancaster
Anyone who knows the identity of this man should call 101. https://t.co/yaeFK9QaEH
@ShellyAsquith sorry, I have plans tomorrow but do enjoy.
@Robmarshall22 is there anything you think you want to tell me Rob? I wasn't aware that a FTFC match was considered a BES event?
As supporting nominations close, Jeremy Corbyn calls for unity in the  Labour Party - add your name too: http://t.co/o4RGX6Sixc
@jabberingjourno I've been chasing the MoD to move on this, Russell needs his medal now.
@fullerfran it would be best if you emailed Jeremy.corbyn.mp@parliament.uk as his office will be able to check his diary for you.
@markt1985 some voicemails which have been left without a phone number lately. Could this be hers? Please call back. Office open after 10.
Westmoreland &amp; Lonsdale CLP nominate Jeremy Corbyn by huge margin: @Corbyn4Leader 27, @andyburnhammp 4, @YvetteForLabour 4 &amp; @leicesterliz 0
A lively Labour Party meeting tonight in Westmoreland and Lonsdale debating who to support for the Leadership... http://t.co/eCNxo51qlQ
Lovely to meet Sue, Frank and Peter from @RosemereCF today - please support our local cancer charity http://t.co/IHxqGCKDQn
Caught up with Lancashire County Council Leader Jennifer Mein - clearly many challenges ahead given government cuts. http://t.co/1kx20kzZWf
@Chris_Altree fair point...
Great evening with @ftfc and met Captain Cod. http://t.co/IN72hVmWLz
@Abby_loves_cake does your email inc both conferences in one email? They're in the same venue over the same days so might be that?
Sometimes I check my emails and I don't have any new emails from a Labour leadership candidate.... But mostly not.
@tomarsemurray Andy by just one vote in the final round of transfer. Jeremy was a very very close second.
@tomarsemurray you missed it!
During #GE2015 @jeremycorbyn was the only leadership candidate to door knock in my constituency and he went down well with people
@GazetteRhodes and you Jon, see you at the footy.
Great @angelaeagle email tonight saying the political elite need to lay off @Corbyn4Leader. It's healthy debate no need for personal attack.
Although we still need a long-term solution to our hospitals funding around Morecambe Bay.
Welcome news that Monitor will recognise the challenging geography of Morecambe Bay Hospitals with a one-off ¬£20-¬£25m for the coming year.
As for those who say they wouldn't serve in a Jeremy Corbyn cabinet... It looks arrogant to presume he'd ask you to.
Colleagues attacking Jeremy Corbyn personally should take a long hard look at why he's connected with membership more than their candidates.
I oppose the Tories attack on our welfare state. That's what I stood on in May and that's how I voted tonight, alongside 47 colleagues.
@spawneedave @dignityindying please write to me for a full response, it's too complex for 140 characters. Thanks.
Great day at #TramSunday. Well done to @FdFestTramSun for another great year! http://t.co/GNu3gCtKQL

Congratulations to a neighbouring MP @timfarron as he takes on the huge new role as leader of the Lib Dems.
@carl_potts a pleasure Carl and a bonus to share part of your journey home with you too. Morecambe Labour Party is lucky to have you.
@XavierBCampbell it was a pleasure and the Labour Party has a bright future with you in it!
@ActionAidUK please can you fix your auto-emailer which is lobbying MPs? At the moment they are coming through without addresses.
@Yorkie71 personally I can't square that, but as a rule of thumb I don't think anyone should make a "sport" out of killing.
@Yorkie71 becoming a sport or a pastime from which joy is taken from killing.
@Yorkie71 point taken on pastime v hobby. I'm fine with farmers et al controlling pest and protecting livelihood. I'm uncomfortable with it
@Yorkie71 I'd like to know more, is this a hobby of yours?
@pook3008 I'll be voting to keep the ban.
@Springleanet Before elected I always earned less than the average wage- I haven't forgotten where I come from! No to Tory welfare cuts
@philtubman no thanks!
@macplus4 looks like I am!
@davebax1974 but if you have any ideas please drop me an email!
@davebax1974 the Beeching cuts were short-sighted and the ongoing issues with reopening would be losing our great off-road cycle track
@davebax1974 nope. Regular Northern Rail service into Lancaster, I kid you not.
@TomSloanBM the problem is they don't! Last week a breakdown shut the line for 2 hours in Cumbria. Unreliable and inefficient
I've spoken in Budget debate about how the "two child policy" on tax credits makes it harder for the 3000 children waiting for adoption.
The PM is right, no Pacer trains running on Barrow - Lancaster line, instead we've got 50 year old Class 37s! #PMQs http://t.co/9EDkOkTrH5

Thank you @wwwfoecouk @frackfreelancs, the councillors and everyone who's been part of this campaign. #FrackFreeLancs wins the day
Fantastic news! Lancashire County Council has refused fracking just now. This news will be going down very well with local residents.
Waiting for #fracking decision #FrackStopsHere #FrackFreeLancs huge local opposition to fracking http://t.co/csZsmFUPnO
@CallumB106X if you tell @wyrecouncil which street that is?
@Equality333 probably not, doing a meeting with a local school at the same time but am aware of it and will try to be in two places at once.
Great meeting with North Lancs and Cumbria @EquityUK branch meeting http://t.co/9A7OB2qRzN

@Yorkie71 @Phil_Comtek @AlbertOwenMP @timfarron I look forward to reading the debate in Hansard as I am still in main chamber for A&amp;E debate
Cracking #PMQs from my colleague @GordonMarsden - why do local ppl get final say on onshore wind but not on fracking? Double standards!
Solidarity with @frackfreelancs @FrackFreeFylde @NorthWestFOE and all others gathered outside County Hall today - keep Lancs frack free!
@Yorkie71 I have a diary clash at the moment but I'm seeing what I can do. Agree important issue.
@pook3008 I shared my thoughts on the BBC last week https://t.co/aguuOXMtCi happy to move out of London
@northernrailorg thanks for the info, you might want to add that to your website as there's no info boards at many stations.
Nightmare that @northernrailorg have cancelled the last train from Barrow-in-Furness to Lancaster tonight... Lack of train staff AGAIN?!
@Phillip_D_Jones no. At the weekend my constituency comes first. I've signed the EDM and have stuff in local press supporting the demo.

@Sargy7 @StTeesYouth chances greatly improved if an invitation is emailed to cat.smith.mp@parliament.uk!
@davebax1974 we do have great cycle routes - plus new Bay Cycle Way! Check it out. But no plans for hire scheme, wud need council support
@LindaWoodhead you did teach me, and pleased you had so many wanting to speak to you at launch I thought I'd catch up back in Lancs!

@steve_race @leicesterliz @CarolineFlintMP in which case that's going to be playing havoc with their NationBuilder records!
Emails from @leicesterliz @CarolineFlintMP tonight addressed "Dear Alison Francis". Suspect some error on mail merge?

@john_heyes I'm meeting with @scope first but will ask questions in parliament too if needed.
@Cruella1 haha! That's good growling Kate, you'd fit right in (not that that's what we need any more of in politics!)
@NicolaPattrick another rural service cut! I'm speaking to the bank to see what provisions they are making.
Will you co-sign my letter objecting to the planning application that will allow fracking in Lancashire? http://t.co/kPdPJO5oIo
It's scary to hear so many Tories denying that man made climate change is real... Such a contrast from what I hear from folk in Lancashire!
A lesson in disappointment in the chamber today. I planned a speech on climate change &amp; haven't been called! But learnt a lot from @KerryMP
@Chrisharrison2 sadly we are losing too many rural services and I will write to them expressing my concern for local residents. Thanks.
@gmack200 cat.smith@parliament.uk is best thanks
@Lorna_M_Culpin you'll need to contact @LancasterCC about noise complaints Lorna, there are details on their website

@rachaellovly email cat@catsmith.co.uk with the details of Monday and I'll see what is possible.
@RebJoyNov did a lot of work on this twelve months ago and outrageous increase this year. Have signed EDM and tabling questions.
@joeljacksonNWEM it's turning into a surreal day - less than a month ago I worked a normal job!
This is my favourite tweet about my maiden speech!  https://t.co/luucQ2k9eJ
@VTLancaster thanks Dan. @northernrailorg can you advise me on this?
@mattfletcher @VTLancaster never liked the Sprinters / Pacers myself but just wish in the north we got a better deal on rail!
It's 2015 in Lancaster, we've lost our 80s 156 Class trains and replaced with Class 37s dating back to the 60s!  https://t.co/npryX4UuLQ
@VTLancaster will this be a permanent solution now the 156s have been transferred to Manchester? Taking rail travel back to the 1960s!

@Trams_to_Lytham *supplying* the trams I'd consider to be a bit beyond my remit! But supporting expanding light rail networks I like.

@janebinnion @LancashireCC if you mean the moving of the J33 on the M6 I'd have thought less traffic through Galgate would appeal to you?

I missed most of #leadersdebate as was travelling home from my own hustings. What I've caught is that Ed's done a great job! #VoteLabour
@reddickpaul @_erica_lewis bringing a whole new meaning to "are you just regurgitating party briefing notes?"
@narco_sam that's what @HannahMFdn promotes and I'm a member of that.
@narco_sam that's very much an election issue, we are campaigning for more powers locally and regionally so very much pro.
@narco_sam thanks Sam, happy to have impressed you!
My first election address in Lancaster and Fleetwood has landed and it's from me! Ah go on then... #VoteLabour http://t.co/zrNTMr3fu2
@AnnSimons10 you're assuming I can't half the costs. Besides isn't the point of MPs that they're accessible?
@AnnSimons10 if I were to be elected I'd hope to have one in Lancaster and one in Fleetwood like other MPs with large constituencies.

@pollypreston our campaign is run on a budget but luckily I've got amazing volunteers so it'll be a people powered word of mouth campaign.
@pollypreston for you too I suppose if you've been subject to having pictures of my face pushed through your letterbox often!

Which tax hits the pensioners and the poorest hardest? VAT. Guess which tax the Tories are planning to raise‚Ä¶ https://t.co/vPv9rQt7Rh
Labour will not raise VAT. It's the tax that Tories love to raise and which hits the poorest and pensioners hardest http://t.co/Dk8reoYdyu

Six things you need to know about Labour's plans to protect animals: http://t.co/Dn4HCyFkZV http://t.co/BkAOjlEGE4
@Yorkie71 @CAupdates @LeagueACS ah yes a typo / human error! That should have read prosecuted.
@Yorkie71 yes I have been emailed about this from people who want to keep the ban. So far no emails from anyone wanting it lifted.
@Yorkie71 @CAupdates the @LeagueACS tells me on average one person every week is protected under the Hunting Act's provisions
@Yorkie71 we shouldn't change any law because it's being broken. It's right that animal cruelty in the name of "sport" is banned.

@janebinnion @LancasterLabour which won't incentivise anyone to go greener and use trains rather than drive!

@NorthyMark2 is that today's issue? Will pick it up in the morning. You coming to the event tomorrow night?
@NorthyMark2 I've already had "Miss", "Ms" and "Mrs" this year - if in doubt use Ms and no one is offended. (Well I'm not)
@molesteeth @LabourLeft it's hard to overemphasise how scary it is, especially for those with underplaying health conditions

@AnneFairweather was 15 minutes not giving it chance? I've seen the lovely vicar on something before so she seems nice.
@AnneFairweather sorry, I'm still totally baffled. Wouldn't you just watch the TV shows if you wanted to? Am I missing something?
Because a few people had mentioned it lately, I just tried watching Gogglebox. I'm sorry I just don't get it... Why??
Just seen the news from Glasgow and suddenly everything in my own life seems to trivial. Thoughts and prayers with everyone there.
Had my Christmas hair cut from the lovely Scott in Lancaster, watching all the last minute shoppers and feeling quite organised.
@StubCrouch lucky you! Their prob is they don't have activists to deliver for them so use pay-for delivery who don't know boundaries.

I have some serious Hanukkah-Christmas shopping to start this morning (eek!) brace yourself Lancaster shops #smallbiz
@LeightonJHughes it's the fact that I'm up and awake at 7am the next day which gives that away? (I have slept. Not an all-nighter)
@CllrPope will do, sadly he's yet to be persuaded onto social media.

Tory MP says the Tories WILL cut the NHS. Proof you can't trust the Tories with the NHS. http://t.co/JQM2XixjTe
@lisanandy congratulations to you and Andy!
The Tories have failed passengers &amp; the public by privatising East Coast. Sign the petition to stop it now: http://t.co/n0dQvjvG0S
@501mossy @prestonlabour thanks for your support and help today - it was a cracking session! #labourdoorstep
@spiritofswanton @ChriswMP well I hope to be an MP who meets with your expectations!
@tim_nicholls BEST. DAY. EVER.
For all the veggies out there, here's a recipe for Lancashire hotpot for you #LancashireDay (h/t @PhilMEdwards) http://t.co/wG7RoPZwHZ
@jon_trickett you do have the National Railway Museum, I won't deny that's worth crossing the border for!
@PhilMEdwards *cough* veggie....
Just an hour left waiting for #LancashireDay - what's etiquette for celebrating? Stuff my face with Chorley cakes and Fisherman's Friends?
Naturally it didn't take Twitter long to start the #ThingsThatAreNotMosques hashtag. Good work Twitter.  http://t.co/uOIeJSaAJv
@Nancy_Platts oh happy birthday! Glad it was a good one.
Today, International Day of Elimination of Violence against Women, remember 155 women &amp; 103 children are turned away from a refuge every day
Great to meet other Christian candidates and MPs at the @ChrLeft fundraiser for the general election last night. http://t.co/fvxLU8k9fy
My inbox is full of emails from people in Lancaster &amp; Fleetwood supporting the NHS Bill tomorrow. I #backthebill but does Eric Ollerenshaw?
Health inequality matters: men born in Blackpool have the lowest life expectancy.  http://t.co/Gu2HsNCAey

@DazaM94 we are ever so friendly ;-)
@DazaM94 @natalieben @PeterTatchell well if you want to help him on his way to retirement on 7 May 2015 you know what you can do!
@DazaM94 @natalieben @PeterTatchell it was fun. Who knew the Tory would upset so many audience members so quickly?!
@JoeSONeill @SCANLU there's an imposter Cat Smith! I totally thought my name was unique #not #Smith
A very moving Remembrance Sunday service at the war memorial in Lancaster this morning #WeWillRememberThem #RemembranceSunday

Solidarity with our firefighters forced to take strike action @fbunational @fbu_lancsfbu govt should give reassurances.
The average caseload held by a social worker has gone up by 34% on last year, amidst government ‚Äúcomplacency‚Äù http://t.co/n3QMIPOsvK

Good morning out on #labourdoorstep in Fleetwood with @GordonMarsden and @SamJRushworth - onto Blackpool now! #FyldeCoastCampaignDay
@MatthewSDent @Markfergusonuk I am chuckling that Mark's northern credentials are being challenged by not having rain protection!
@Markfergusonuk can't wait to welcome you here, hope you brought waterproof as Lancashire is providing its usual welcoming weather!
@nasmith59 met a voter in Lancaster today who told me he'd not be taken in my ukip. He told me they are Tories in disguise! #sensible
@becajhall then we can join everyone in the Water Witch afterwards! Such a good pub.
Tried to canvass @becajhall family today - sadly I missed them! #labourdoorstep
Solidarity with my @BASW_UK colleagues at Britain Needs A Payrise demo #18Oct carrying the banner for social workers #BritianNeedsAPayRise
@thebigredkeith and importantly this government should never have scrapped Remploy factories which did work for disabled workers.
@thebigredkeith on wages think it's a dangerous precedent to say disabled workers worth less, feeds into discrimination when equality needed
@thebigredkeith I'm sure Kate is enjoying the peace and quiet, but joking aside sorry to hear about the vent.
@thebigredkeith hi Keith, I've said that I believe in equal pay for equal work regardless of disability (or gender/race etc) how are you?
Now enjoying @ChriswMP contribution that we should look to Latin America to an alternative to neo-liberal economics and austerity.
Smashing contribution from @IanLaveryMP at @labourassembly - we have a country of working poor who don't feel any recovery.
Brilliant vote in Parliament to #RecognisePalestine tonight. Must be followed by real pressure from UK to end Israel's occupation.
@Noordad you were very welcome and I hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed your company.
@Noordad thanks, I'm looking forward to seeing you again
@lizrob92 thanks Lizzie, it's always an emotional talk to give but an important one. Support @PSCupdates and be the change you want to see!
I just asked my MP to vote for the UK to recognise the state of Palestine. Join me at http://t.co/ekqWuHK3gl via @PSCupdates
@LancasterUni happy birthday, may the next 50 years be as successful as the first 50 years!
@MRMweb it feels like the end is nigh with the weather, and now the kitchen blind has collapsed on me... #itsgoingtobeoneofthosedays
Raining so hard in Lancaster this morning that rain is coming IN my bathroom extractor fan. Urgh. Phoning my Dad for help, obviously!
@three3hartleys @LancsLabourClub @GrahamJones_MP if course, and many were already members having joined before coming to Uni!
Fantastic @LancsLabourClub freshers week welcome social - exciting to see so many new members there. Thanks @GrahamJones_MP for speaking.
@spiritofswanton @CharlieWoof81 hospital?! Get well soon. Sending you all best wishes.
@nickth86 @MRMweb it's pronounced differently to how we way it, true true. Barra til I die. Etc.

Thank you to all from @LancsLabourClub @LabourStudents running the freshers stall at Lancaster Uni today - sounds successful!
@cheri1990 sorry you feel disillusioned, perhaps if we met you'd see I'm quite normal! As for rich, lol. Last month I made ¬£1.19 last a week
Unusual day in the office today. I helped my colleague shave off her (long) hair for @macmillancancer - so I've donated of course.
@cheri1990 It was too Lancaster-focused with all vox pops from there. If you want to fight back please join Fleetwood Labour!
@labourpress on Saturday afternoon I met a woman in Lancaster who waited 5 hours at A&amp;E. She'd had a heart attack. Tories are failing us.
