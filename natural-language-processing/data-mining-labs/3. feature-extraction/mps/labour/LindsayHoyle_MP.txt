@eleanor4epping Congratulations, Dame Eleanor! Hugely deserved.
Been informed that Lancashire Teaching Hospitals Trust are dropping car parking charges for renal and oncology patients.  Awaiting confirmation from the Trust
Terrible news for local justice - Chorley Magistrates will close on 29th March.  Minister says closures make business sense as 41% of courts operate at 50% capacity - slash the number of bobbies on the beat in Lancashire by 750+ then court use will drastically fall I suppose. https://t.co/ueSoFJfl00
Massive praise for @LancashireFire @manchesterfire firefighters who worked through the night to tackle the Fairport fire in #Adlington - @ChorleyCouncil is working to accommodate residents if they are unable to return home tonight.

I'm holding my surgery tonight 5pm - 6pm at Chorley Town Hall - all constituents are welcome to attend.
More Parking Eye chaos at @LancsHospitals - pictures from constituents showing there is just one machine working, people queuing to pay in order to get treatment or visit loved ones. Outrageous. I'm meeting @ParkingEyeLTD first thing tomorrow.
Such tragic news that Dianne Oxberry has died of cancer at the age of  just 51 - I know how much she meant to all of the @BBCNWT team and of course to her viewers. My thoughts and prayers are with Dianne's family and friends.
Brief spot on @SkyNewsPolitics @DermotMurnaghan - all campaigners, journalists, MPs &amp; public have a right debate outside Parliament without abuse. What @Anna_Soubry faced was just plain wrong - I know from my meetings today the @metpoliceuk @ukparliament authorities will respond.
@CllrMTomlinson @MattHancock @DerianHouse @StCatherinesPre Rest assured I did not forget it is Chorley and South Ribble CCG the meeting - I merely ran out of characters above!
He listened and questioned what I had to say and said he'd look at all my concerns - I take him at his word that he will look at what the DoH can do!
This evening I met with new Health Secretary @MattHancock - robustly discussed need for full reopening of Chorley A&amp;E plus the need for CCGs across the whole NW to fund @DerianHouse @StCatherinesPre - both lovingly care for those from across our region but only Chorley CCG pays.

I'm encouraged that that @northernassist and @RMT have both agreed to recommence talks at ACAS to resolve the fiasco over trains in the north of England. We must find a solution - I have asked the Transport Secretary to provide any and all support to ensure these talks succeed.

@TaiPan_StraunCo Well, each to their own but I disagree - it's different to the other statues of the men of the past but I think it's intentionally a change from the imperial style. But then again I'm no expert on statues!

The snow has started to fall in Chorley https://t.co/8iS3iDFLEO
Following our successful lobbying I welcome the government's commitment to creating an Combat Air/Aerospace Strategy. The industry is vital to Lancashire directly and through supply chain. But we need action on orders and sixth generation aircraft post-Typhoon, not just words. https://t.co/XTmFwmK5oZ
More road repairs needed throughout Chorley https://t.co/jyx5uCSksR
Talking to residents at this afternoons fourt demonstration against Clayton Hall Landfill Site https://t.co/yXdn53tsYZ

I have received reports that a nursery had been advised to keep children indoors and windows shut.   @EnvAgency and @ChorleyCouncil have confirmed no statement has been issued.  Please contact my office if you have any further information relating to this.
BBC News - BT told to share poles for ultrafast fibre internet - broadband access and speed remains a major issue in Chorley, I was meeting only today to discuss an action plan - this is a very positive step - news https://t.co/d4gIA1G0sq
I understand from @PostOffice that Heskin Post Office is out of action for the next 4 days due to essential building works - alternate sites Eccleston, Carrington Centre or Mawdesley on New Street.
I know I'm biased as I share an office with @ChorleyCAB but they do great work in our community, thanks to @CitizensAdvice for today's briefing - here are some details of they've work done recently #workingtogether #chorley https://t.co/DI1KWifkap
@ChorleyCAB @CitizensAdvice I'm hoping to attend - I'll update later this afternoon!
Supporting residents today at the 3rd #StoptheStink demonstration against the awful smells from Clayton Landfill Site https://t.co/bcMA8Ffwud
Spotted over #Chorley doing a figure of 8 @RoyalAirForce https://t.co/roR7cqJ5Hz
I have received confirmation that Coppull Post Office has successfully recruited a temporary postmaster and has re-opened today, whilst I continue to push for Adlington to re-open as well!
Don’t let the weather put you off, there’s great fun and activities to be had at @chorleycouncil Town Hall today #WinterPlayDay https://t.co/pJ6prMDle8
Congratulations to all those who won a #noda award. @ChorleyTheatre  Impressive 9 winners including best panto!
Visited the Prince of Wales and Bay Horse in Chorley which have received £150,000 of investment.   They are 2 of 700 stonegates pubs across the country which employee over 14,000 people. https://t.co/pBhm0DNEi7
@EnvAgencyNW @LancashireCC  https://t.co/VJh9CL1oif
I visited Clayton Land Fill today &amp; met @EnvAgencyNW - been reassured that land fill has ceased on site &amp; will be backed up with a legal notice. New monitoring equipment to be installed as well. I still think @LancashireCC has a role to play examining potential planning breach.
Great to see people of Chorley uniting this evening in a celebration of diversity in our communities https://t.co/hIxK8DJJjY
@ChorleyCouncil lights up to celebrate #vote100  and the suffrage movement https://t.co/TZgGK4bspv
It is 100 years since the Representation of the People Act 1918. This allowed some women over 30 to vote for the first time and was a democratic milestone. As part of these celebrations @ChorleyCouncil will be lighting the Town Hall clock in the 3 colours of the suffrage movement https://t.co/VCWIh61kMp
I joined residents today to send a clear message to shut the site #ClaytonHallLandfill https://t.co/lSGbYQvauY
Always good to catch up with the members of the Armed Forces &amp; Veterans #BreakfastClub https://t.co/tSRhEwg1L9
I was appalled by the smells residents have had to endure from the Clayton Hall Landfill site. https://t.co/xxHi4IxPk0
I’m aware there’s an issue with water supply in Astley Village. My office is in contact with @unitedutilities and I understand repairs are ongoing, and they hope to have completed the work in the next few hours.
Here is the list of LCC road repairs for this period, disappointing that some of the worst roads - Miles Standish Way &amp; others aren't mentioned. Hopefully LCC will review my additional requests. https://t.co/wJysjhuXAs
I'm calling on @PostOffice to provide mobile services in Coppull and Adlington following temporary closures. Insulting to suggest all pensioners can get to Chorley easily or walk across Adlington to access their pensions.
I know that potholes are a blight everywhere due to budget cuts but today I've had email after email from constituents about the dangers of Miles Standish Way/A6 junction and damage to vehicles. I've emailed @LCC Chief Executive directly for urgent repairs.
I've just had a meeting with Courts and Justice Minister @lucyfrazermp - made it clear that Chorley Magistrate Court should stay open - there is demand, we need local justice and to save precious time for police and witnesses. Transferring to Preston will not work. https://t.co/JE7sHiqGwi
Thanks @networkrail for update that you're working to clear the way to pay the arrears of some 300 small companies who work for Carillion within rail supply chain. Work on electrification between Manchester &amp; Preston/West Coast must go ahead &amp; any local suppliers paid.
We stopped today in Chorley to mark Holocaust Memorial Day. Important not only to take time to remember the millions who were murdered and persecuted but vital to educate and warn against creeping return of facism and anti-Semitism  #HMD2018 https://t.co/SIcQDYLhcF
It's Big Energy Saving Week &amp; @ChorleyCAB want you to help you save money on your household bills so visit https://t.co/955Kk1Klss  #BESW2018
My team has been busy over the last few weeks - working on the future of Chorley Magistrates' Court, fighting Dial-a-Ride cuts from LCC, responding to policing issues in Adlington plus Clayton Hall Land Fill. I'll resume press &amp; social media to update residents in coming days.
Thank you for the decency &amp; compassion you’ve shown our family when we need it the very most. The condolences we've received have been an immeasurable source of strength over the last few days. I’m deeply touched by the amount of kindness &amp; love shown in Chorley &amp; Westminster.
I am truly devastated by the death of our beautiful daughter Natalie. Our family will never be the same without our loving granddaughter, sister &amp; aunty. Thank you for the kind support we've received it is overwhelming. Please continue to respect our privacy &amp; allow us to grieve. https://t.co/e5BuXUgnAk
I'm really very concerned about the spike in serious crime in Adlington @LancsPolice really don't seem to be responding - violent break ins and car theft. I raised this with #Chorley Chief Inspector last week. People feel disillusioned with police response.
Qatar buys 24 Eurofighter Typhoon jets in £6bn deal - very welcomed news before Christmas for workers at Warton &amp; Salmesbury, Lancashire needs this contract. But still need to see further contracts and commitment for Hawk jets for Brough.  https://t.co/mEnPughqa8

@djmmcghee but other local trusts have not encountered this problem - there A&amp;E units haven't closed...
@Lostock_HallJFC @Cllr_Mike_Green - not true. No plans submitted/actioned for new build, it'd take a decade. Long term it may be a solution.
If Hospital Trust management are incapable of re-opening A&amp;E at Chorley they should step down and allow others to take over
Spoken NHS Improvement - they are investigating decision not to re-open Chorley A&amp;E
Hospital Trust announced Chorley A&amp;E won't re-open until April 2017. Absolute disgrace, local people deserve better!
