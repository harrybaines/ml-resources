I'm deeply saddened to see colleagues leave the Labour Party. We must remain united in the fight for our party's values of internationalism and equality for all. That is the only way to bring an end to this Tory government and deliver the change our country so desperately needs.
Fair comment. https://t.co/h8Z9WurZpG
Lovely sunny morning @HighgateNewtown Community Centre for our Friday constituency advice surgery. Busy ...
As for the Prime Minister taking us out of the EU without a deal, we’ll see about that. https://t.co/89whSNn4k5
The Prime Minister’s Brexit strategy has once again been defeated. She can no longer claim to have a ‘substantial and sustainable majority’ in Parliament.    We can’t go on like this. Parliament must decide what happens next. https://t.co/ts092D1MiT
Packed room tonight for a really engaged local discussion in Camden with our Somali community about keeping our young people safe on our streets. Thanks to @SYDRCLONDON for organising and everyone for coming. https://t.co/cbOm1AXzF4
.@CamdenCouncil has been working with the Camden community to create a draft Clean Air Action Plan of ideas for improving air quality in the borough. Visit https://t.co/aFCtmVxrjh by 15 Feb to have your say about tackling air pollution in Camden. #CleanAirCamden https://t.co/ZMYELWjuoi
Thanks for hosting me @BambosMP &amp; thanks to all @UKLabour members who attended. Your voices need to be heard. https://t.co/WorVYk2QKO
Unbelievable. Do we really have to remind the Prime Minister that she was the one who cancelled the vote before Christmas? https://t.co/yZ9n86Avyw
We have got to put a hard stop to the Prime Minister running down the clock on Brexit and trying to impose a binary choice between her deal and no deal.   This week Parliament needs to say enough is enough - and to take control of what happens next.  https://t.co/Q8RHF22iAx
Great day of discussions in Birmingham with @PreetKGillMP including lively session @unibirmingham https://t.co/hCVmphRaKz
This letter sets out in robust terms that the Prime Minister must abandon her Brexit red lines. It does not take the option of a public vote off the table. https://t.co/T0bk7vq8cZ
Here we go again. https://t.co/151w9ygHHu
Great event - thanks @CroydonNorthCLP @SteveReedMP for inviting me. A reminder that our values of internationalism and solidarity must drive our agenda ... https://t.co/bLkC9y0iaG
When @Theresa_May visits tomorrow she must listen to the concerns communities have about no deal.   An open border is more than a line in the road, it’s the manifestation of peace. https://t.co/O5mxi69r09
Good to be back in Northern Ireland earlier today with @JennyChapman and @tony4rochdale to meet with businesses, trade unions and political leaders.
If confirmed, this represents a serious blow to the communities that depend on the jobs Nissan creates and supports.   The Tories’ chaotic handling of the Brexit negotiations is having a devastating impact on business investment. It’s time ministers got a grip on this crisis. https://t.co/i6I9Xy56CL
Great to be in Nottingham for this @EastMidsLabour conference packed with members &amp; questions. https://t.co/7uBu0C7RRv
See you there! https://t.co/XWs1qfUpVW
There may be snow outside, but our constituency advice surgery is as busy as ever: lots of issues arising, but, as ever, housing tops the list of concerns. Thanks to my great casework team, we’re getting through the long list.
For Tory backbenchers to support an amendment cutting across the PM’s deal is one thing. For the PM to support them is quite another - unless she had indications from the EU that they would agree the necessary changes. But she hasn’t. https://t.co/8FcoRcoCnJ
Parliament has an important chance today to reduce the risk of a no deal Brexit.   Labour will support amendments, including @YvetteCooperMP’s, which will allow Parliament to fill the void of leadership left by the Prime Minister.
On Holocaust Memorial Day we remember and we recommit to fighting all forms of hate. And support @UCL_Holocaust in its work to safeguard the future by learning about the past.
Thanks @LabourMacc for inviting me &amp; good luck in the May local elections in Macclesfield! https://t.co/TGIN2TClho
On my way ... and looking forward to it @LabourNorthWest https://t.co/WaSsxZJOSW
Fascinating visit to @WorcesterBosch today to see the production line in action, discuss the future of energy supply in the UK and, of course, brexit - and great group of apprentices! Thanks all. https://t.co/MhxVbv4Se7
Sorry not to have been able to join the @UCL_Holocaust team's #HMD2019 commemoration event earlier today because of Brexit commitments. I hope the event went well - and thank you to all of those involved in organising.
This is a stark warning from Airbus about the disastrous consequences of a no deal Brexit. When will the Prime Minister start listening to business rather than the extreme Brexiteers in her party? https://t.co/7JEKHd10UL
As we pause to remember the horrors of the Holocaust, I want to acknowledge the incredible work of @UCL_Holocaust which is helping teachers and students across the country ensure we never forget the tragedies of the past. #HMD2019 https://t.co/RqdmAZAC8B
Answering questions from my CLP and being held to account is an important part of the job. As is making sure I hear members’ views on Brexit directly. https://t.co/76gChXQfEY
The door was open. Her mind was closed. @hilarybennmp spot on. https://t.co/htC6nQh6RM
So much for the cross party talks. https://t.co/W7fjmCDHf1
Today I spelled out the next phase of Labour’s approach to Brexit, the credible options that are left available to us and how we will honour the commitments we made at our conference last year. #FEPSFAB10  Read my speech here: https://t.co/L3WhNSHBpF
Enough of this man. Not fit for any office.  https://t.co/IUqlCxWU9W
For months I have been saying that PM’s threat of ‘my deal’ or ‘no deal’ was a hoax. Tonight proves it. There is no way forward without taking ‘no deal’ off the table. https://t.co/HJxl6lryaq
My reaction to tonight’s #BrexitVote https://t.co/UV3ryMgWie
Labour’s push for a meaningful vote all those months ago has been vindicated. Parliament’s verdict on the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal is clear and decisive. We can’t go on like this. #BrexitVote https://t.co/uOi4Gcv5Ur
This evening Parliament finally gets the chance to pass its verdict on two years of failed negotiation.  Labour has always made clear that we won’t support a bad Brexit deal. Today we deliver on that promise. https://t.co/eiqAeZmnoH
Absolutely spot on @HarrietHarman - my friend &amp; colleague @TulipSiddiq should not have to do this. Time to catapult Parliament into the 21st century! https://t.co/zY502CVbzw
Well done @LadyBasildon and team. Right result. Tomorrow the House of Commons delivers its verdict. https://t.co/N4lMS7gvYA
The Prime Minister has once again failed to deliver.   This is a long way from the significant and legally effective commitment the Prime Minister promised last month. It is a reiteration of the EU’s existing position. Nothing has changed. https://t.co/LC7213Fv05
Not sure that’s a boost. The ‘no deal’ rhetoric needs to be abandoned next week as soon as the PM’s deal is inevitably defeated. Then Parliament can decide between the then existing credible options. https://t.co/2Fln4uQQVD
Early meetings with two local tenants groups done, now onto our busy Friday constituency advice surgery. Thanks to Queens Crescent Community Centre for hosting us (and providing coffee &amp; biscuits!) and to my fantastic casework team for their work.
Number 10 is simply wrong. It would be unthinkable for MPs to only be allowed 90 minutes to decide what happens next in the event the Government’s Brexit deal is voted down. As ever, the Prime Minister is simply seeking to shut down debate. https://t.co/jQVqMwB3x9
Contemptible. But in keeping with the govt’s Brexit approach to date. MPs will not tolerate this. . https://t.co/Hj4hXqKFvd
That’s good to know ... and timely! https://t.co/La86904Ixe
Thank you Aaron &amp; good luck. Sad to see you go. https://t.co/UtvRgVEkTr
The Government’s decision to delay the meaningful vote has run down the clock and increased the risk of a no deal Brexit.  If the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal is defeated next week, she must return to Parliament as soon as possible and give MPs a real say on what happens next. https://t.co/e4JyFEtitw
The Prime Minister’s reassurances on her Brexit deal amount to nothing. The Government could never have frozen Parliament out of the choice of extending transition or entering the backstop. PM has not delivered the significant changes that she promised. #PMQs
If the Prime Minister’s Brexit deal is rejected, Parliament must decide what happens next. This amendment has Labour’s full support. https://t.co/aWs9vSBgyp
Really important victory on @YvetteCooperMP’s amendment. I’ve always said Parliament won’t accept a ‘no deal’ Brexit. This is an essential first step and more will follow. https://t.co/kr071jAeZn
Really important cross-party letter about the catastrophic consequences of a no deal Brexit on jobs and the economy.   There is no mandate - and never has been - for a no deal Brexit. Full support to @JackDromeyMP and others on this important issue. https://t.co/a2ZURXo80r
‘Managed no deal’ is a contradiction in terms.   https://t.co/lMMNtEQflU
Good. If true, needs to be changed straight away. https://t.co/SUcgxYDiuB
The greatest Labour constituency party!  ... thanks for all your support in 2018. Onwards and upwards for 2019. https://t.co/b6YonaQqaX
Happy New Year one and all.   Let’s hope 2019 is a year where long established values of internationalism, cooperation and collaboration overcome populism across Europe and the World.
Ridiculous situation for the UK to be in. Combination of false Brexit promises and useless government. No deal has never been viable and, as every day passes, it becomes less so. https://t.co/QuzBCjn0Yd
So pleased &amp; proud for you @CloughJohn - for you and Penny it has indeed been ‘hard and personal on so many levels’ but your commitment to improving victims’ rights is the more incredible because of that. https://t.co/DAmUuUsqk0
Good spirits, as ever, in the best pub in the land @ThePineapplePub for a quick Xmas drink before lunch!
Happy Christmas one and all.  And thanks to those working today - and any day - to keep us safe and well.
Our children have decided to leave two rich tea biscuits &amp; a glass of milk for Santa: &amp; a carrot for the reindeers. Hmmm ... https://t.co/A3O9rQAqqH
A good way to remember Paddy Ashdown. A sad loss. https://t.co/QVaCS9QaXh
After a busy few weeks in Parliament on Brexit issues, it’s the ‘Horrible Histories’ show tonight with our children at Alexandra Palace!
A no deal Brexit would be catastrophic.   No government has the right to plunge the country into chaos because of its own failure. The majority in Parliament must have its voice heard.   That’s why I will be applying for this emergency debate today. https://t.co/mIYKlq8WtK
Bitterly cold outside but a warm welcome here as we start our Friday constituency advice surgery at the Crowndale Centre in Camden. A chance for me to thank my excellent casework team for all the really hard work they have put in (yet again) this year.
It seems that the Prime Minister has failed in her bid to deliver meaningful changes to her Brexit deal. We cannot go on like this. The Prime Minister should reinstate the vote on her deal next week and let Parliament take back control.
Too right!   One year on, we see how important this is ... https://t.co/AvCCr2otNX
Result also shows how badly the PM would have lost the vote last night on her Brexit deal had she not cancelled it. Again, more trouble ahead ... https://t.co/59JvTNOIV4
200/117 for Theresa May shows Tory civil war on Brexit is far from over. More trouble ahead.
This Government is falling apart before our eyes. The Prime Minister's deal is so bad she isn't even willing to put it to Parliament. The country deserves better than this. https://t.co/vBLcMzwZKe
It is unthinkable that the Government tried to keep this information from Parliament - and indeed the public - before next week’s vote. 3/3
All week we have heard from Government ministers that releasing this information. could harm the national interest. Nothing of the sort. All this advice reveals is the central weaknesses in the Government’s deal. 2/3
Having reviewed the Attorney General’s legal advice, it’s obvious why this needed to be placed in the public domain. 1/3
Today’s finding of contempt is a real low point for this Government. By treating Parliament with contempt, the Government has lost the respect of the House. #ContemptOfParliament https://t.co/VNq5xLczUy
Ministers have repeatedly refused to release the Attorney General’s full and final legal advice on their Brexit deal, as ordered by Parliament.  We have been left with no option but to press ahead with contempt. This is our cross-party motion that will be debated tomorrow. https://t.co/iy2YpXTaJ8
The Government has failed to publish the Attorney General's full and final legal advice on the Brexit deal, as was ordered by Parliament.   We have been left with no option but to write to the Speaker of the House of Commons to ask him to launch proceedings of contempt. https://t.co/LNfUmHg7Tb
On @RidgeonSunday I warned the Government that it is heading for deep water if it doesn’t publish the full legal advice on the Prime Minister’s deal, as ordered by Parliament. #Ridge https://t.co/q1eGkkKd8C
So the PM insists that MPs cannot see the AG’s legal advice on Brexit while members of the Cabinet feel free to leak it! Completely unacceptable. https://t.co/ZOzKbUIMO3
Good. As I have said repeatedly, Parliament is not going to fall for PM’s ‘my deal’ or ‘no deal’ bluff. That’s no way to decide such an important issue as our future relationship with the EU. https://t.co/H4zJahDHib
Thanks @KentishTownCC for letting us hold the advice surgery with you today. https://t.co/xMQN4bbgfk
Very important Labour amendment. https://t.co/7V4AG7lQpK
It’s Friday. So it must be constituency advice surgery day! This week I’m with my great casework team at Kentish Town Community Centre. Coffee round done and about to start ...
This is very good. Watch ... https://t.co/kMDybF34n1
Rounded off the evening with a packed public meeting with residents about the devastating impact of HS2 in Camden. Lots more work for my brilliant casework team ... but that’s why we organised it.
Very determined to get to this event tonight to say a big thank you to Camden Carers for all their important work. https://t.co/8EiSLODGlB
Fantastic event in Camden tonight, focussed on homelessness and how we can all change perceptions and save lives. The artwork by @DavidTovey1975 got everyone asking questions - mainly about themselves. @LivingCentreNW1 https://t.co/hpgPEOomh1
Great amendment @hilarybennmp and others - full support https://t.co/lZrkxWj9vR
Really? Celebrating those who made promises they could not keep ... then just walked away. https://t.co/WJ873MLnS2
Passion &amp; commitment here as we discuss with Camden Safer Neighbourhood Board how to reduce youth violence and keep our young people safe. https://t.co/5Xac2wtYbR
If anyone wonders what the impact of eight years of Tory austerity has been on our country, look no further than the UN’s damning report. https://t.co/QgXi5bUKyS
Not good enough. Parliament won the right to see the full legal advice and that is precisely what we expect to see. Labour will not let ministers off the hook. https://t.co/PVP3ROudwc
Congratulations @Sagal_AW - much looking forward to working with you. https://t.co/KNN5LOf3ei
My tube journey home ....  Good to see you @shilpensavani https://t.co/u0zBRcPoJF
My letter to David Lidington demanding publication of the government’s full legal advice on its Brexit deal in the next two days. Parliament is entitled to know full legal implications of what the Prime Minister has signed up to. Full transparency and rigorous scrutiny essential. https://t.co/I20A2CUck9
This is a bad deal for our country.   It’s a failure of negotiation by a Prime Minister who has spent more time arguing with her party than working in the national interest. The result is a deal that no-one supports.   Labour will vote against it. https://t.co/q5ze9D4IQr
Yes @CloughJohn I will. Thanks for all you are doing. https://t.co/T0uGCggR2k
This is a further failure of negotiation.   Promises have been broken and serious questions about our future with the EU remain unanswered. This is not a deal Labour can support. We will vote against. https://t.co/qHQrSrrB9c
Amber Rudd is right: Parliament will stop no deal. I hope the rest of the Cabinet was listening and will finally drop the reckless no deal rhetoric. https://t.co/te86KKdg1m
Quite right. Thanks to all those supporting this amendment tonight. https://t.co/QCVMY3pWva
Really fantastic work by Byker Community Trust refurbishing Tom Collins House. A busy day in Newcastle and good to have a positive end to a busy week! @JillHaley11 https://t.co/RGLdXmtaDC
Great event &amp; great people at the Newcastle East Labour Fundraiser last night, including the legendary raffle! Thanks to Nick Brown MP for inviting me. https://t.co/l6YzQMkROx
Great to spend the day in the North East talking about regional business needs, housing and, of course, Brexit! https://t.co/bH50Aw1dAI
Common characteristic of leading Brexiteers. Make promises that can’t be delivered. Then walk away from responsibility by resigning or never step up. https://t.co/VdrunCdkMM
Judgement day on the Prime Minister’s deal. My verdict. https://t.co/4ZGaqzEedO
After a long and busy day, just starting an evening constituency advice surgery in Camden. Luckily I have my excellent casework team with me and strong coffee to hand. Long queue already ...
This is now an incredibly serious situation. The Prime Minister’s Brexit deal has fallen at the first hurdle.   When Theresa May makes her statement to Parliament this morning she can’t stand up and say ‘nothing has changed.’ She needs to urgently to rethink her approach. https://t.co/IG0vf8LVUK
The opposite of what has been promised for two years.
Vague in the extreme on the future relationship (which is meant to be the government’s preferred option).   Not good enough for manufacturing, not good enough for services and lacking any robust safeguards for our vital rights and protections.
Careful reading and analysis of the Government’s 500 page ‘deal’ reveals that it’s a miserable failure of negotiation.   Huge detail on a backstop (which government says it doesn’t intend to use).
Too right. https://t.co/A8H3l3BTdr
Important victory today. Govt needs to be clear and accountable about the legal implications of any Brexit deal it seeks to push through Parliament.    https://t.co/Urwc9qeo7Q
Given the shambolic handling of these negotiations, this is unlikely to be a good deal for the country.  Labour has been clear from the beginning that we need a deal to protect jobs and the economy. It’s not in the national interest to vote for a bad deal.
Remembering all those all over the world who gave their lives. #RemembranceSunday2018 https://t.co/6tU3kXCiX1
Labour will stick to its guns. We will not support a bad deal nor will we allow Theresa May to take the country off a cliff.  We will work with all sides to defend the national interest. https://t.co/ZroyIj918K
Difficult to find words to describe this ... https://t.co/B44IDXxqtI
The no deal rhetoric from the government is a bluff and we shouldn’t fall for it. https://t.co/7iAL1O8kZa
Early start heading to Brussels for further Brexit discussions with EU politicians and representatives.   Labour will not back a blind Brexit that’ll simply increase uncertainty and open the door to a Tory hard Brexit. That’s not in the national interest. https://t.co/hsSKlvTVPj
Insightful article from @TomKibasi. It's not in the national interest for Parliament to back a bad Brexit deal that put jobs and the economy at risk. https://t.co/hO8kSY9m4k
Important article by Saul Lehrfreund about abolition of the death penalty in Malaysia. Reflects years of hard work by committed campaigners &amp; lawyers including everyone @DeathPenaltyP https://t.co/7c3fkPwI1z
The sad death of Jeremy Heywood is a huge loss to public service. A real champion of the civil service and a remarkable man.  https://t.co/9wWiuai0V5
Speculation or not, a backstop proposal cobbled together for the Cabinet falls far short of the comprehensive customs union we need to protect manufacturing and deliver on the solemn commitments to Northern Ireland.  If the Brexit deal fails Labour’s six tests, we’ll vote it down https://t.co/15RMisTLqm
This is truly shocking. Victims of human trafficking and modern slavery are among the most vulnerable in society.  If the Tories are serious about ending the hostile environment, they’ll drop these plans.  Well done to @paulblomfieldmp for uncovering. https://t.co/gVBokAvbFL
It’s staggering that ministers are making companies sign these gagging agreements.   The Government shouldn’t be silencing businesses, but being honest about the fact that a no-deal Brexit is simply unthinkable. https://t.co/WnAGrlFb5X
Thanks for landing us in the biggest mess for decades. But no. We absolutely do not want your return. https://t.co/ymcxq1N2NK
Really great Yorkshire Post awards night @gregwrightYP - celebrating the best of Yorkshire! https://t.co/92zW4Ij4yl
These are serious allegations and it’s important that the National Crime Agency is allowed to investigate this matter in full. The public must have trust in our democracy. https://t.co/bbBtZgGSVt
Looking forward to it @gregwrightYP https://t.co/LjUnMUoUyZ
This must be one of the quickest u-turns in political history. @DominicRaab told MPs that a Brexit deal would be done by the end of November. Three hours later his own department was forced to correct the record. What a mess. https://t.co/L0nrbpoqws
Piloting another ‘pop up’ advice surgery in my constituency today. Last one was at Camden Mind day-centre. Worked very well. Today’s is at a local nursery for parents dropping children off.

In politics, not every day is positive! But to join others tonight to welcome to Camden a young Syrian refugee family who touched down in Gatwick 4 week’s ago after 5 years in a refugee camp was truly uplifting. Thanks to all those who made it happen. https://t.co/ftYO9yZmJK
It's too late for the Government to be preparing for no deal. This is panic, not planning, from government ministers. https://t.co/LTUAG8e2qV
I’ve written to the @CommonsProcCom to make clear that Parliament won the right to a  truly meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal. We will not let ministers wriggle out of this. No ifs, no buts. https://t.co/ZmOt9l7Krf
I disagree with Theresa May on many things, but comments made about her in the newspapers this weekend from unnamed Conservative MPs is nothing short of disgraceful. That kind of language has no place in our politics. https://t.co/wsBuu8eOCB

Congratulations to my friend, colleague &amp; neighbour @TulipSiddiq - yet another reason for us all to fight for proxy voting in Parliament for MPs on maternity or paternity leave. https://t.co/QS7jveZtje
Looking forward to our meeting @NathalieLoiseau https://t.co/VfN90BUgr9
Got back from Dublin to Camden just in time to attend my local CLP monthly meeting. Really important to report back, face questions &amp; be accountable. Very positive meeting @CamdenLabour
No. I’ll get onto it. https://t.co/BFUwo2C8iw
Great to have further discussions with you @JohnJMcGrane and to hear Brexit concerns of @BrIreCham https://t.co/1ev9YMz8gK
Great to meet you in Dublin @AnTaobhRua https://t.co/TkTvx9eAZw
Just landed in Dublin for an important set of Brexit meetings today &amp; tomorrow with government ministers, politicians &amp; businesses. Maintaining the solemn commitment to no hard border &amp; North/South cooperation is a must.
Seriously troubling. This is what we need to focus on. Not Johnson’s latest self-serving rubbish. Shared European values are under attack and need robust defence. https://t.co/FYeMGiK0D6
Good to be at @The_TUC today talking about how we protect against a ‘no deal’ Brexit. If PM’s deal is rejected or she fails to reach a deal, Parliament should decide what happens next and all options should be on the table.
On the early train to Manchester for the @The_TUC conference. Back to back Brexit discussions ahead.
New venue for today’s constituency advice surgery: Crowndale Centre while Town Hall closed. But, as ever, my great team are ready for what looks like a very busy session. Coffee in hand ...
Great to be in Portsmouth today talking to local people and businesses (from small businesses to Airbus) about the impact of Brexit on them. A great deal of concern ... https://t.co/CbEW9n6MfF
This is a fantastic result. Well done to all those who campaigned and argued the case. Long overdue; but a big step forward. @HumanDignityT https://t.co/VKhQKrt0c6
An important @IPPR report laying bare the wealth inequality at the heart of our economy - and making a strong case for fundamental reform.  @TomKibasi https://t.co/UQ9wgFrMSM
Congratulations @sianberry https://t.co/jqW7L7EGGD
Full IHRA definition and all examples: a necessary minimum to begin to restore trust. https://t.co/PE6hRUkk1V
Typical Johnson. False promises. Then refusal to take responsibility for his own actions. It’s always someone else’s fault. https://t.co/1vVD4OtvHR
A gross betrayal of democracy is a prime minister who insists that the only choice is her deal or no deal. https://t.co/5r8bGy65M9
Totally wrong approach by the US. Palestinians who rely on this funding will bear the brunt yet again. https://t.co/d2MDouTg7z
Great to meet you @AntB1969 &amp; great local! https://t.co/CjXKA1G1EM
That’s not a very high bar! https://t.co/8h3kogjiPX
A lovely tribute. Still hard to accept that our friend &amp; colleague was taken from us. But tributes like this remind us of how Jo reached across borders. https://t.co/a6R3hKr9JO
Looking forward to it @gregwrightYP https://t.co/EfT15tRKUh
A ‘no deal’ Brexit would hugely damage the UK. The govt’s so called ‘preparations’ barely scratch the surface. We need to challenge the reckless rhetoric of a ‘no deal’ Brexit every step for the way. https://t.co/CohRgrqo5p
This man knows nothing of Northern Ireland. https://t.co/Q8htHUlxUP
Good meeting &amp; discussion today with my friend &amp; colleague @AnnLinde Swedish Minister for EU &amp; Trade about Brexit &amp; the political situation in Sweden. https://t.co/30y719cPrk
Just do the right thing and unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU citizens in the UK. Labour has called for this from July 2016.  https://t.co/RE8SA5T3Oi
Apparently the Brexit ‘no deal’ impact papers due out on Thursday are likely to be ‘quite short’.  Not surprising. It doesn’t take long to explain that a ‘no deal’ Brexit would be hugely damaging for our country. https://t.co/AYr0Hdh7W4
Completely unacceptable. Either make speedy decisions (i.e. under 6 months) or let asylum seekers work. To do neither is a denial of human dignity. https://t.co/hw8TrbYQgT
Nonsense. EU is UK’s single largest trading partner. That’s why the deal with the EU matters so much more than this fantasy politics. https://t.co/M9A1ItafRq
Queen of soul. Listening right now. https://t.co/cCol3d5Z11
Good luck to all Camden students getting A-levels results today. Whatever the grade, be proud of the work you have done &amp; celebrate. Thanks to all the staff &amp; families who did so much to get them this far! #resultsday2018 #camdenschools
Looking forward to it @SouthwarkLabour https://t.co/vojZdIuLXW
Quite right. Child poverty is the injustice of our time. https://t.co/7wzBIynFlJ
Let’s see: No deal will hugely damage our manufacturing &amp; service sectors &amp; make the solemn commitment to no hard border in NI impossible. Either ERG accept this &amp; expose themselves for what they really are (unlikely); or pretend away the consequences of their politics (likely). https://t.co/4L7QuENrxf
Just awful. All thoughts are with all the families &amp; friends of those who died or were injured. https://t.co/57apLv0YX1
Whenever &amp; wherever we go away, its always great to get back to Holborn &amp; St Pancras. Much to do ...
Congratulations @NorthLDNCares &amp; the inspirational @alexsmith1982 who drives this important project forward. https://t.co/oKfzJNnWIC
Me neither. Nor a former foreign secretary who looked less fit for office. https://t.co/JAgnEv7xeJ
Yet the compensation scheme offered to those who will suffer  high levels of noise &amp; pollution of every type for years in Camden is designed to ensure almost everyone will fail to qualify! https://t.co/mgnWtn3C55
Meanwhile residents &amp; businesses in Camden face years of disruption &amp; blight. https://t.co/mgnWtn3C55
It’s always about him. A man who never takes responsibility for his self-serving decisions, including false promises about Brexit.  https://t.co/8St0bCOCLO
Very important report by @VeraBaird - that’s why support for victims of domestic violence before &amp; at court is so crucial. https://t.co/zuFHuByjvy
No deal would be a catastrophic failure of government, which no government should survive. The cause: PM’s reckless red lines, Tory divisions &amp; fantasy Brexiteer promises. Parliament has a duty to prevent it. https://t.co/1Pq6S5FtC2
Important part of the message that needs to be heard loud and clear: anyone who denies that anti-semitism has surfaced in our party is part of the problem. https://t.co/7M7Abc0K6w
Classic comment of leading Brexiteers: always accuse others &amp; never take responsibility. https://t.co/CT0U88w32u
Great to celebrate. The campaign now is to ensure homosexuality is decriminalised everywhere, worldwise. https://t.co/a8vUXH12Kr
Right; that’s it. After a busy few weeks &amp; months at work; I’m swapping my suit for shorts &amp; T-shirt &amp; going away with my family.
Lovely event. Thanks for the warm welcome &amp; the invitation to speak &amp; face questions @BuryNorthLabour https://t.co/5ypb48Mdj0
Great to join you @BuryNorthLabour https://t.co/6NZvDJmA4n
Great join @JamesFrith today to talk to businesses &amp; trade unions in Bury about their concerns about Brexit: concerns rising by the day with the mess this govt has got itself into. https://t.co/907wWLIwgh
Quick spot of early evening canvassing today with @JamesFrith for the forthcoming East Ward by-election in Bury. Good luck team Labour! https://t.co/RWBv3kPFcA
Good to meet my friend &amp; colleague @AndyBurnhamGM in Manchester this morning to discuss the impact of Brexit in the North West. https://t.co/SidLPrqF0d
Great work @AlfDubs - govt should honour its refugee children commitment not go back on it. https://t.co/taoKbqSiIK
Great event in Brighton tonight with Labour members discussing the challenges of Brexit &amp; the need to transform Britain. Thanks @hovelabour for hosting. https://t.co/dDnWsdJFbk
Well said, Parvais Jabbar (who has dedicated his professional life to fighting the death penalty worldwide &amp; knows what he’s talking about). @DeathPenaltyP https://t.co/Y1Po0MomTU
That didn’t take long! Less than two weeks into the job ... https://t.co/hcEKlTRrXS
This is appalling. Successive UK governments have always sought assurance on the basis that justice can be done without resort to the arbitrary and inhuman penalty that is the death penalty. We need the UK to lead on fundamental rights, not follow. https://t.co/i0Vh0ACJe5
The greater the scrutiny, the less those responsible want to be held to account. So much for taking back control ... https://t.co/JM20Z3Pbxq
If more evidence is needed to show that the PM needs to face down her hard right Brexiteers, this is it. The Tory civil war, once confined to their own party, now threatens our country. A huge fight back is needed. https://t.co/Qkpecescm6
Thanks @WokinghamLabour for inviting me, for being so welcoming and for challenging me in the Q&amp;A. We will only progress and succeed if we accept challenge and unite. https://t.co/jJAkIlCFC1
Thanks @MarcusBoyland @QCCA_CEO and Gill Fraser for organising a great event at Queens Crescent today. https://t.co/6CO7NFrw8W
Well done @LDNVictimsComm for your tireless campaigning on these issues. The comprehensive bill of rights you are pushing for is much needed. https://t.co/glgInwSfAt
Usual self serving hot air from Johnson. No serious answers to the difficult issues that confront us. No responsibility for the havoc he has caused. Very typical ... https://t.co/SRiXY35V4s
Desperate from the govt; and wrong for so many obvious reasons. https://t.co/HefztG6zMH
Very significant defeat of govt tonight on European medicines regulation amendment. Near miss on customs union amendment. Margin is closing on these votes &amp; we will keep at it.
Very serious findings. Completely unacceptable for VoteLeave not to co-operate with inquiry. Police investigation should go wherever the evidence leads. https://t.co/Ymigk3vdr4
After the shambles of the govt’s release of its Brexit White Paper in Parliament today, all is orderly here in our busy constituency advice surgery in Camden this evening thanks to my great casework team! https://t.co/NnkaU22HKc
So proud of this England team. Great team spirit; great attitude; great manager. And a great future ... https://t.co/vtntVLBLi2
Great work Georgia &amp; team. Camden cheering on England! https://t.co/bu614LURPn
Fantastic news. Really fantastic. Let’s extend this united spirit to all children at risk everywhere. https://t.co/ioYYDPyE88
Hard to argue with that verdict. https://t.co/ubQGkKxwON
Theresa May’s Brexit strategy has failed. Parliament must take the lead.  https://t.co/2q3DJyhCCU
Four hours later, Boris Johnson goes. Division &amp; chaos at the heart of govt. https://t.co/qr71HAo77x
The appointment of Dominic Raab changes nothing. The divisions at the heart of government over Brexit remain as deep as ever.
Lovely obituary of Stephen Plowden: an incredibly committed &amp; well informed critic on all things transport including HS2. Not in my political party, but I spent time with him &amp; listened to him because I respected him &amp; what he believed in. https://t.co/GlAqnkObnI
Great spirit from the Swedish Ambassador here in the UK - well said Torbjorn! https://t.co/mNDqSiso0c
Let’s wait to see the detail; and whether it survives contact with Tory MPs &amp; members. Lots of obvious gaps. https://t.co/RRzARMkkfC
Great event - thanks for invite @Labour_Business https://t.co/HXxEpyRGww
Looking forward to it @MSLSolutions https://t.co/hCB2hdooyx
A pleasure to welcome Camden Youth MP, Athian, and his two deputies, Jessie and Asma, to Parliament. I’m looking forward to working with them over the next two years, especially on youth safety issues. https://t.co/m6GRfq74W6
How many warnings does the govt need before it abandons hard brexit? https://t.co/BtdVmUOBGa
Good to have further Brexit talks with @simoncoveney today. The solemn commitment to no hard border in N.Ireland must be kept. Customs union &amp; single market alignment only viable option. https://t.co/NSNO6atxrl
Watched every minute. Stood up for the penalties. Nerves! Seems to have trick @gilescoren https://t.co/jmSxbdPfmn
Yes! https://t.co/6TPWkm2f4l
Morning assembly with a great group of young people with disabilities @ElfridaCamden - a very uplifting start to the week! https://t.co/6a5AquxPI7
Less @Jacob_Rees_Mogg - more national interest needed. https://t.co/IOtmF32hF1
This is the heart of the problem. Tory divisions led us to Brexit. Tory divisions prevent a way forward. Here and across EU, time is running out on this Tory indulgence ... https://t.co/VuiY2L7s4h
Yet another busy Friday constituency advice surgery: case after case of acute housing need. Adequate &amp; truly affordable housing is long overdue.
Last December, the PM solemnly agreed to no hard border in N. Ireland. Six months later, still no detail on how to deliver on that promise. Customs union &amp; single market alignment only viable solution. Let’s agree that &amp; move the talks on. https://t.co/18hh0GDht4
It was a great event. Thought provoking &amp; inclusive. @CamdenLabour at its best. Thanks to our fantastic panel. https://t.co/XZxEZNOLAz
This is a fantastic step forward - mandatory death sentences anywhere in the world are inhuman. Years of persistent hard work by @DeathPenaltyP &amp; colleagues pays off. https://t.co/XtB5Q0rMNy
Just through channel tunnel after busy 2 days of Brexit talks with EU27 political colleagues &amp; speeding to Holborn &amp; St Pancras for the Big Debate tonight. Great panel of speakers discussing our future economy. https://t.co/7t807NiToc
Positive talks with Roberto Gualtieri &amp; Italian MEPs in Brussels. Followed by further talks today with @PES_PSE progressive colleagues across EU27. https://t.co/QW8ekKapwj
Not. https://t.co/usNRlRSxge
A privilege to address political leaders, colleagues &amp; friends from across all the EU27 countries today in the S&amp;D Group session ahead of the EU Council this week. Lots of common ground. https://t.co/ZRCE1UXSbv
My privilege. @LimeCulture does vital work training ISVAs  &amp; supporting front line professionals responding to sexual violence. https://t.co/t6IucnPuqV
This is going to be a great event. Fabulous speakers, good topic. Join us. https://t.co/7t807NiToc
Great to celebrate Caversham GP and NHS with my predecessor Frank Dobson, who opened the centre &amp; always champions the NHS. https://t.co/zQW1LMf29y
Always good to bump into @MichaelLCrick but near midnight on a broken down train in the middle of nowhere not ideal! It looks like a long journey home ... https://t.co/Md5BoXgIeJ
Thanks @the_winch for discussing your vital work with me. Long admired all that you do for young people in Camden. https://t.co/Z4UIg1G8JJ
Thanks for hosting us @RegentHighSch https://t.co/krsHYoMVZE
Leaving Euston on a train to Liverpool &amp; looking forward to joining my great colleague @angelaeagle for a busy Brexit discussion with members of her constituency.
Great morning talking to students @RegentHighSch about youth safety this morning with my colleagues @TulipSiddiq &amp; @abs_hai https://t.co/4Fm50rrLe1
If proof was needed that the PM’s Brexit red lines need to be abandoned (and fast), this is it. https://t.co/LfryvwcHkC
Glad to be there. HS2 is causing great anxiety to so many Camden residents. My job is to listen to their concerns &amp; do something about it. https://t.co/cVeNXAQP8x
No point complaining about the vote. But refusal of Tory whips to follow convention for seriously ill MPs today was disgraceful. https://t.co/FMURiibfhr
Real disappointment. We could have won that vote. But this does not end here. We will take every opportunity to ensure that we get a fully meaningful vote on the Article 50 deal. https://t.co/QqsV7yNRxT
Humanity and dignity. Two words not understood by President Trump. A truly ‘great country’ treats all people with humanity and dignity. https://t.co/GvmpgpkJIy
Good - PM only avoided defeat last week by promising a concession that she then went back on. Now Commons gets another vote on this vital issue. https://t.co/uiqysdbShk
Welcome @JanetDaby https://t.co/PftSGOYwZm
Packed day of Brexit meetings in Brussels. Hoping to be back home in time to watch the England World Cup game!
Hoping to get that amendment back to the Commons for a vote on Wednesday #meaningfulvote https://t.co/4W6KIPZp9O
Fantastic news @momenulhaque - a remarkable journey taken with huge courage https://t.co/yBfLyfmnB6
Two of our residents came in early for advice and have just returned with a round of strong teas for the team. Lovely! https://t.co/3huhCeOFtB
It’s 9.30am Friday: so it’s constituency advice surgery time! Already a very long queue of residents needing help. Lucky I have such a great support team with me.
An incredible march. Grenfell families are entitled not only to justice &amp; but also to a complete overhaul of housing policy.  https://t.co/tgJzeJuaU9
PM has gone back on her word. Govt amendment takes the meaning out of a meaningful vote. Parliament should reject it. https://t.co/IhvZAj5QYS
It will be a privilege to be there to launch this legacy to the late Stephen Tindale: a great campaigner on the environment &amp; a friend. https://t.co/mxw3MoUMhv
All those whipping up hatred &amp; intolerance in politics need to reflect on this. https://t.co/uZr9vhtjTR
Facing defeat, the PM has bought time. But not much time ... https://t.co/7j2WVxXnTV
The ‘meaningful vote’ amendment is crucial. If the PM’s Article 50 deal is rejected by Parliament, she cannot be allowed to implement ‘no deal’. Parliament needs to decide what happens next. https://t.co/kjDV8QXX9w
Labour fighting leading argument on transitional arrangements; coining the fight for a meaningful vote; flushing out impact assessments; putting govt in a corner over customs union; and proposing single market deal not worth a mention @guardian?  https://t.co/9sOosFArpM
Papering over  the cracks ... again. https://t.co/JLpZM56eBt
Great work @CamdenLabour https://t.co/K2RlseNEoX
Clear analysis by @RCorbettMEP explaining why EEA/Norway model is not the answer.  https://t.co/PmJJkiiBFN
This is the real battle. If PM’s Article 50 deal is voted down in the autumn, Parliament must decide what happens next. Crucial we hold onto this amendment next week. https://t.co/A8EnQTWtX2
My privilege @LimeCulture ISVAs are so important in sexual &amp; domestic violence cases. https://t.co/qa9hYLCNnQ
Agreed.  https://t.co/cT0kLOi1Ov
And this is the promised land advocated by hard Brexiteers? No thanks. Labour’s commitment to a customs union with the EU is the only way to protect jobs and the economy. https://t.co/91zl2XfqUq
Think you may have overlooked that all six tests are based on Tory Brexit promises. David Davis coined the “exact same benefits” promise. PM said she was “determined to meet” all my tests. You may have lowered your expectations. Why should I lower the tests? https://t.co/j2l0NNt7da
Some people obviously missed this from weeks ago. It’s pretty straightforward. https://t.co/WCEGkOyHyg
Thought long &amp; hard about responding to this from @campbellclaret - his core argument - that I have ever suggested that Labour will not vote against a Tory Brexit that fails our 6 tests - is bogus. But at least it gives me the chance to reiterate that!   https://t.co/aB32GMX1LG
Usual loyalties set aside tonight. Come on Liverpool!
Yes https://t.co/atAb00MxSb
It’s a yes from me @katymfallon https://t.co/wgzqgpvYwq
Great @YnysMonLabour event tonight. Thanks for such a warm welcome. https://t.co/abTDTv50Qc
Came to Port of Holyhead today to discuss Brexit impact here in North Wales with all concerned. There is no substitute for visiting. Thanks @AlbertOwenMP for setting up. https://t.co/flxRkDjAkq

Good meeting with Canadian High Commissioner @JaniceCharette today. https://t.co/H3u7cYtY5q
Thanks @Daniel_Cousins https://t.co/CYoVKq3xwv
This aspect of life as an MP is so important. Reporting to our local parties and answering questions. Thanks to my CLP for all their fantastic support. https://t.co/Lc16jCTsd9
Good. Bring it on. Tory divisions have driven the agenda for far too long. Hard Brexit needs to be defeated. https://t.co/ZKPTsQZzdg
Well deserved @williammclennan https://t.co/m68z6p5r6i
Congratulations @NewJournal https://t.co/xOwbNdBTdX
Long standing Labour policy. Six tests for the govt’s proposed Article 50 deal. If not met, we vote against. And, if we hold onto our crucial Lords’ amendment, Parliament decides what happens next.    https://t.co/33duvf0QFB
Great day in Wales yesterday. https://t.co/V64fWo3qZ1
Very significant intervention from the Met Commissioner. Govt should listen hard ... https://t.co/25nc8zA1M4
Beautiful sunny room for my Friday constituency advice surgery today. Everything needed is to hand: my great casework team, a long queue of residents wanting help, but no coffee!
Great to meet you @ionewells - quite a crowd on the late train back to London tonight! https://t.co/TlQrzwLsbg
Outside the ‘Red House’ in Merthyr with @GeraldJonesLAB before my Keir Hardie lecture. Hardie used to deliver speeches from the balcony behind us! https://t.co/gRl25B5jJR
Great team out in Barry @WelshLabour https://t.co/jyIqtSg6lE
Busy day today in Wales discussing impact of Brexit on farming &amp; food industry, meeting local businesses &amp; communities. Ending with the privilege of delivering the Keir Hardie memorial lecture in Merthyr Tydfil tonight.
It was great to talk @BurghHouse1704 tonight with a fantastic group - thanks for coming https://t.co/d5DLamSqdi
Great event. Great discussion. Thanks for inviting me. https://t.co/i9Eo0yDdlq
On the train now, John! See you later ... https://t.co/KoVbxBYlog
Great to be there. Keep up the good work. https://t.co/5Q9kHfNBz8
Shooting at and killing unarmed protestors can never be justified: full stop. Robust investigation &amp; full accountability urgently needed. https://t.co/sNyXVnsMmW
What a farce. Cabinet fighting over 2 customs options: neither workable; neither acceptable to EU; and neither would get support in a vote in Parliament. https://t.co/lodaidOjcm
Just arrived in Brussels for full day of Brexit discussions tomorrow with senior politicians across EU27. Much to discuss including importance of retaining benefits of single market &amp; customs union.
Such sad news. Tessa was loved, admired &amp; respected by everyone. An incredible individual who fought incredible battles to the end. https://t.co/oygJ1vVVJX

Home from Camden Council election count at 5.30am. Starting very busy constituency advice surgery here at Camden Town Hall at 9.30am. Ouch ... so glad to have my fantastic casework team with me!
Celebrating the re-election of our three fantastic Kentish Town  ward councillors with huge majorities! @CamdenLabour https://t.co/nqIBvrKsaV
Great to be out here in Belsize Park with my good friend &amp; colleague @TulipSiddiq https://t.co/ljGKCvPbmW
Glad to be out supporting our great @CamdenLabour candidates today. https://t.co/rEaluCDHfx
Good luck all @UKLabour candidates tomorrow, especially our very own @CamdenLabour candidates. So much hard work put in; now for real results &amp; real change.
So much for transparency &amp; accountability. This speaks volumes. https://t.co/lvRguQeKn8
This amendment simply gives legal effect to PM’s solemn commitment to ‘no hard border’ in N. Ireland. And govt voted against! Rightly defeated ... https://t.co/maYulVLSaE
Infighting not national interest at heart of government .. . https://t.co/JJCYnIDBRU
Great to be in Plymouth to support you @Asterinidae - and good luck tomorrow. https://t.co/F2ShzTksC9
Fabulous Labour team out today in sunny Plymouth including @CharlotteHollo campaigning for widely admired candidate Pam Buchan. Very positive vibe on doorsteps. https://t.co/vt7LUhVso8
Probably the most important amendment &amp; victory so far: if MPs reject PM’s Article 50 deal in the autumn, Parliament decides what happens next. Now to ensure we hold onto it in the Commons ... https://t.co/bMkqN7MyH9
The amendment is simple but vital: if MPs vote down the PM’s Article 50 deal in the autumn, Parliament should decide what happens next. https://t.co/kphLuwkMn1
Thanks @SittSheppLabour https://t.co/ZWR90TFsVD
Another great @CamdenLabour team out today, with the added bonus of being joined by our friends from @SittSheppLabour - thanks to all. https://t.co/3SLdx7prFW

Good to speak about this @GusAlston &amp; thanks for @KTCityFarm response. https://t.co/T4sMLe0cW3
Thanks Ange! You gave our brilliant @CamdenLabour candidates &amp; hardworking campaign teams a real boost this morning. https://t.co/mzZCTv25lJ
Thanks for the visit @CRbuildpeace. A dedicated peace building team that deserves all our support. https://t.co/cQdLcmCygA
Not good enough. https://t.co/7hTs4yihyA
Looking forward to this event - direct 1:1 conversations with young people in Queen’s Crescent. Every voice needs to be heard in making Camden safer. https://t.co/8BHRPU7cmI
Govt does not have the courage to have the EU customs union motion put to a vote today! Tells you what they think the outcome would have been ...
Thanks @Nlondoncitizens for organising meeting. We all have a responsibility to ensure the safety of young people in Camden &amp; Islington. https://t.co/0RcMyAaZSO
Great to campaign with you @vellstells - you deserve to win. Good luck! https://t.co/Vl1IrDN7iy
Busy session out on the doorsteps with one of the hardworking @BarnetLabour teams tonight. https://t.co/FfajBrK7qE
On my way from a great Bloomsbury Festival event @ucl to join a great @BarnetLabour team canvassing this evening! Escalating at Warren St on the way ... https://t.co/fz23s8PkE6
First the hard Brexiteers blamed the judges, then their own MP colleagues, then the civil service ... now the House of Lords. When will they take responsibility for the consequences of their own actions? https://t.co/Sff2eQ04hh
You should have come over and said hello. Good luck with job interview @grantbogarte1 https://t.co/9M2anON7Wh
Thank you @UsdawUnion for such a warm reception at your annual conference here in Blackpool. https://t.co/DipMRywroW
Good. Thank you @DLawrenceOBE for your incredible &amp; tireless campaigning against racism and for justice. https://t.co/JRbmJB2Zrq
Productive meeting with Deputy Prime Minister of Belgium today about the Brexit negotiations. https://t.co/oHt3IaopRT
Another key victory. No one voted to reduce human rights protection in the UK or reduce access to justice. https://t.co/INGhvAwWt4
This @LDNVictimsComm consultation is really important: help ensure that victims get effective services tailored to their needs to help them access justice, cope and recover. Runs until end May. https://t.co/VaJWxnvqJN
The question is not how PM manages her own party - that has dominated Brexit for far too long - its about our national &amp; economic interest. Staying in customs union with EU should always have been a priority. https://t.co/dqlslnH9pj
Sad truth is that UK imposed most of these offences during the colonial era. That’s why we have a special responsibility to get them removed now. https://t.co/O836gPMjiN
Busy afternoon with @BatterseaLabour - great candidates fighting for a really significant ‘Labour gain’. https://t.co/QgV9Uzgs0i

Fantastic to have @UKPatchwork volunteers out campaigning with our great @CamdenLabour team here in Highgate today. Thanks to all. https://t.co/D4oKG5ekwD
Merci Arsène https://t.co/2NgxPl7XAF
Thanks @ClaireLLeyland for your contribution. Great to have worked with you on this important project - and best wishes for the future. https://t.co/50L3xc8DVv
Thanks @LivingCentreNW1 for hosting us - great space for a busy constituency advice surgery today. https://t.co/tyJa8NQENS
Sometimes debate in the Commons is an endurance test. Today it was a privilege to be there to listen to debate on cancer treatment in honour of @TessaJowell - cross party recognition of an incredible woman fighting an incredible battle. https://t.co/b7nlQEBKlp
Pressure coming from all angles now on PM to change her position on customs union with EU. Crunch time is coming. https://t.co/UGMQaW9jbU
Looking forward to this: see you Saturday in Wandsworth @MarshadeCordova https://t.co/2ZHt9h2F3t
Great team &amp; great campaign @HighgateLabour - as ever @CamdenLabour https://t.co/YoDhl6gS0y
Huge step forward on customs union with EU. Careful work paying off. Now to hold it in the Commons. https://t.co/XlHaJStkh6
If your immigration policy is based on creating a ‘hostile’ environment - the PM’s own strategy - this is where you end up. https://t.co/YavhY97tpD
Two important debates in Parliament today. First, challenging the govt for not seeking Parliamentary authority for air strikes in Syria. Second, being absolutely clear that anti-semitism has absolutely no place in our politics.
Looking forward to continuing my discussions with everyone @QCCA_ltd - part of my ongoing work with Camden’s Youth Safety Taskforce to reduce knife crime. https://t.co/BDklmG4bof
Having won a meaningful vote on PM’s Article 50 deal, we’ll apply our longstanding 6 tests to her deal. If tests not met, we’ll vote against. Meanwhile we’re pressing amendments so if vote goes against the PM, Parliament decides what happens next. Pretty straightforward really.
Labour fully supports the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects, including no hard border. Crucial this is fully respected in the Brexit negotiations and beyond.
I’ll be there. https://t.co/dX9XeCgpHC
Bombing is not the answer. But we cannot just look away: concerted &amp; effective international response needed. https://t.co/XPm3nIF5hi
Not the only cause ... but impossible to argue not a contributory factor, along with other cuts.   Govt respose to recent terrible crime, including here in Camden, should be open minded, not openly defensive. We need a joint strategy that works. https://t.co/6klvPvzHFF
Political rhetoric does not change lives: ‘sure start’ does - giving young children a chance often against the odds. Really tragic to see this Labour legacy being dismantled - a retrograde step if ever there was one. https://t.co/c3KRqfYKth
Sad news - a great player for club &amp; country: respected wherever he went. Big loss for football.  https://t.co/va4UnhWSmq
Good. https://t.co/lTLqR1QN4M
Absolutely the right person for the right job @carolyn4deputy - and the campaign for funding for child funerals is an example of her passion, tenacity and commitment as an MP. https://t.co/ipgyyc3oe3
Right decision. https://t.co/CwVOsZFIIq
These cross-party amendments show the progress we are making towards Parliament deciding whether we stay in a customs union with EU &amp; deciding what happens if PM’s Article 50 deal is voted down. Calm, patient &amp; crucial work. https://t.co/tUP16VZ0FO
Really important discussion on community safety @QCCA_ltd - huge priority of mine as MP. https://t.co/mkaZwDlHH7
Good meeting: positive &amp; practical outcomes. No.1 issue: community safety.  @MPSHaverstock &amp; I have a clear ‘to do’ list! https://t.co/D8ZIGYshuT
More than that: Labour will press for an amendment making sure  that if PM’s Article 50 deal is voted down, govt can only proceed on terms then agreed by Parliament. ‘Take it or no deal’ is not an acceptable choice. https://t.co/8zGf4VrLoR
Full support @ConorMcGinn https://t.co/uWWinB0uLH
Watch this clip. When confronted with his own sexism, Johnson’s reply is simply “I meant no harm”. Tells you all you need to know about him. https://t.co/2BKNEzXpNI
You have been brilliant @SallyGimson - determined to bring about real change, committed to social justice &amp; hugely respected &amp; liked by all those who repeatedly voted for you. A real force for good. Thank you. https://t.co/JalItyA2HD
Thanks @IrelandEmbGB for hosting: the historic achievements of the Good Friday Agreement cannot be sacrificed on the altar of hard Brexit. https://t.co/aQKxbmaMaL
Full text of my speech today: Parliament should decide what happens if we vote down PM’s proposed Article 50 deal, alternative of ‘no deal’ is not meaningful; and we need to enshrine the commitment to ‘no border’ in Northern Ireland in our domestic law. https://t.co/Wq53uOO5CU
Labour rejects the notion that if we vote against the PM’s Article 50 deal, then ‘no deal’ follows. That is not a ‘meaningful’ vote. If the deal is voted down, Parliament must decide what happens next. We need options on the table. https://t.co/t5IhhCkfFh
Serious questions needing an answer ... https://t.co/31fCbJ39sW
Brilliant campaign by @carolynharris24 - her absolute determination to get this change has been inspirational. https://t.co/ezLAeuk3S3
Enshrining the solemn commitment to ‘no hard border’ in Northern Ireland in law is now a must. Working with others, Labour intends to force the PM’s hand on this vital issue.  https://t.co/JW70xL1EKG
On my way ... https://t.co/YER5qp0sjF
Great Milton Keynes team out this morning @SELabour - campaigning for more Labour councillors this May &amp; two new Labour MPs at the next General Election (whenever it comes)! https://t.co/z9sVeNwPXD
Rushing through Euston station to get a train - this time to Milton Keynes - it must be another Labour Action Day!  Back this afternoon to re join our very own @CamdenLabour teams.
Congratulations @DanJarvisMP - great result. https://t.co/QxsQi0M8KC
Back to Camden Town Hall for this week’s Friday constituency advice surgery. Look’s like we’re going to be busy ...
Thank you John. https://t.co/bF7H3wX4Fc
Camden’s response to knife crime: powerful messages. https://t.co/8bohj2MR16
A silent march against violence. Please join us. We have seen violence, grief, anger &amp; despair in recent weeks. Time for change. https://t.co/c3HTTuOr8b
Great to meet politicians from Norway, Switzerland, Iceland &amp; Lichtenstein today to talk about all things Brexit. https://t.co/VeliOWi49q
Full support. https://t.co/tZjBc6QIYN
Over promising; under delivering: the government’s Brexit strategy. https://t.co/bln4xwzyAP
Thanks @SophieKLinden for coming. Great to have a direct link to your work with @MayorofLondon on these vital issues. https://t.co/gmVhTJFSXj
Sceptics of @camdentalking ‘community conversation’ initiative should have come along tonight. Lots of residents from all sorts of backgrounds coming together in Kentish Town to make a difference. Inspirational. Thanks all. https://t.co/9UcZGbZ4aH
There is a reason this man has never held any position of responsibility. Long may it last. https://t.co/SG2r0yibhB
So glad to hear this @lilacswan1 - good luck with the studies! https://t.co/9aLdTNIyze
Great event. Yorkshire at it best: innovative, gritty &amp; successful. https://t.co/LQmuCn2Nyx
Really important @YJLCUK event about children &amp; criminal justice: not discussed enough in my view - looking forward to speaking alongside @DavidLammy &amp; others. https://t.co/16dtXvSPRd
On way to Leeds, a city close to my heart, to join @gregwrightYP &amp; @WardHadaway to celebrate Yorkshire’s #fastest50 businesses ... and, of course, to discuss Brexit! https://t.co/a1JIXEfRjH
Good to see you @freecola2 - my team &amp; I are working on the Albert Thompson case. Thanks for raising. https://t.co/dfYL4v3ZW7
Well done @AngelaRayner - important victory. https://t.co/1if9lZ2a0c
Great meeting of Kings Cross residents tonight: an open ‘quiz your MP’ event. And they rightly did! https://t.co/8TK4SM2v5F
You should be proud of the work your granddaughter is doing on the school council @EGAReducation https://t.co/BqCDuq3V9F
Your granddaughter should be very proud of the work she is doing on the school council @letsget_talking https://t.co/Qj5QjiMgXK
So great to be with our very own Gospel Oak Labour team tonight. Friends &amp; colleagues working together to win elections &amp; change lives. https://t.co/EMmXbgMLqp
Real privilege to open this conference. Lots of participants who work with young people but don’t get the thanks they deserve. Focused on outcomes, but mixed with deep grief about recent events locally. #camdenyouthsafety https://t.co/WsjaLyNS1r
John &amp; Penny. You are an inspiration. To turn an unspeakable horror into a positive campaign to protect others takes such incredible courage &amp; guts. Proud to stand with you. https://t.co/xePRNoHh7e
Well said @CloughJohn https://t.co/7LfLMhUzFA
Great to talk to @bbcnickrobinson for his Political Thinking podcast: the ups &amp; downs of growing up, Brexit, Arsenal &amp; how I didn’t notice burglars stealing my TV!https://t.co/hjhjVBk1rp
Clear Labour policy for a long time now. There is an alternative to Tory Brexit.  https://t.co/33duvf0QFB
Coffee &amp; water to hand. Excellent senior caseworker at my side. Ready for a busy constituency advice surgery in Holborn &amp; St Pancras today!
Survived my grilling by @GospelOakSchool school council. Best question: “what’s the funniest thing in Parliament”? I gave a diplomatic answer! https://t.co/m0bXwAaPvX
A great school; and a great school council. Look forward to being quizzed by you before I start my constituency advice surgery this morning! @GospelOakSchool https://t.co/fz6hSvZuOy
Good. https://t.co/TKbzpSdDXW
Great evening last night @eleanorpalmersc - advice from my 7 year old daughter as I took the stage; “Daddy, it’s your turn to blah blah blah!”. https://t.co/uvm4Sjzrmz
Great session at De Montfort University this afternoon with students &amp; staff: full house &amp; lots of interest. https://t.co/TpYbVDsEeJ
Heading to Coventry for TUC regional conference. On International Women’s Day &amp; everyday, the fight for equality goes on. @The_TUC has a great woman leader in @FrancesOGrady to help lead that fight.
Looking forward to joining you. https://t.co/RzAsNClMEA
Well done @camdentalking @AdamDKHarrison - an important step in tackling air pollution, a critical issue in Camden. https://t.co/NPbWWbeEBY
Thank you @JaneOwenFCO for setting up a very productive round of discussions. https://t.co/T0iHvAo9ys
Yes, of course @lisabaglin https://t.co/P8TzklhVR6
Just landed in Switzerland for full round of political meetings about Brexit, Swiss/UK relations and much else.
Great @CamdenLabour team out today @RichardCotton10 - thanks to all. https://t.co/BWvtW3d6qj
Easiest negotiations in history; exact same benefits of the single market &amp; customs union; trade deals waiting to be signed. All these false promises bit the dust today.  https://t.co/85SL4cdMHV
Lots of words, but in the end reduced single market access &amp; PM driven to resurrect long abandoned &amp; unconvincing customs agreement proposals previously described by her own ministers as no more than ‘blue sky thinking’. Wrong priorities. https://t.co/tNGNPm1TVb
Great fundraiser in Oxford tonight; thanks to all @Oxford_Labour for making me so welcome - just made it home through the snow. Not such a great night at Arsenal! https://t.co/KguWaLfQog
Tests are what you apply to concrete proposals put forward by others. What we need are concrete proposals put forward by the PM. Her ‘red lines but no plan’ strategy has run out of road.   https://t.co/4pFnkNyIGa
Important statement of principle by Chief Coroner; especially for Jewish &amp; Muslim communities in  Camden.  https://t.co/faxh9TKmdu
It’s a bit chilly, but I’m on my way!  Looking forward to seeing everyone at the @Oxford_Labour event tonight. https://t.co/Du8nm5EAGc
If the PM faced down her hard Brexiteers, abandoned her ill-thought out red lines &amp; showed some leadership, we would not be here.  https://t.co/aDXdwKLZXX
Despite the snow, record speed for check in at St Pancras for the 6.47am to Brussels! Busy schedule of meetings ahead including joining the weekly meeting of our great @UKLabour MEPs.
Johnson joins the ranks of those prepared to put their hard Brexit ideology above the solemn commitment to ‘no hard border’ in Northern Ireland. Parliament must stop them.  https://t.co/27XzIPQmQQ
This is so crass it’s hard to know where to start. The usual story with our Foreign Secretary. https://t.co/qo7O1TZON5
Labour puts jobs &amp; the economy first. Business supports. Fox attacks. What sort of government is this that puts hard line Brexit ideology above all else? https://t.co/cSFUml27HZ
Really sad to hear of the death of Paul. A first class lawyer, who approached life with warmth and humour. And a friend. He will be greatly missed. https://t.co/PUt4AnDwF9
Strong Brexit speech from Jeremy Corbyn this morning: close future relationship with EU; in customs union; and strong single market deal with no drop in rights, standards or protections. https://t.co/snv1Y7lIzM
Agreed. Local community shocked, but pulling together. Thanks also to @SYDRCLONDON for support at last night’s meeting. https://t.co/QOqe9OYZv1
Now in Barnet to support our great Labour team. With a big push, we can win the Council here in May! #ActionSaturday https://t.co/hQz4Enk7RG
Great Watford team out today! Thanks to all. https://t.co/xPlQYWdGH4
Further great work by @NW5PROJECT with Peckwater residents &amp; neighbours in Kentish Town. https://t.co/8Si4qZhxhB
On my way to join @DawnButlerBrent to campaign with @EofELabour team for our great local candidates in Watford. Bumped into @JonAshworth at Euston going the other way to campaign in the South! #LabourActionDay
Really sad to see @IainMcNicol go. He led his @UKLabour staff with courage, conviction and dedication. Tireless and professional.  Ahttps://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/feb/23/labour-general-secretary-stands-down-from-position?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other
Understandable grief, anger, fear &amp; strength from our local communities tonight after awful knife attacks. The courage of the families of victims attending moved us all. Now we must all challenge ourselves in response. https://t.co/v0dFsnd9nD
Fantastic visit to @LaSainteUnion this morning. Congratulations to whole school for @BritishCouncil #internationalschoolaward https://t.co/5Y95crMqFS
What planet is he on? https://t.co/Blybj7y4P3
Let’s hope not. https://t.co/3Qzt425rtW
Happy anniversary @The_TUC    Much needed then and now. https://t.co/TImMWHUUhu
These awful events are truly shocking. All thoughts are with the victims, their families and all those affected. Will be working with all relevant authorities today to reassure our communities, keep them safe and ensure a full investigation. https://t.co/OhKQU7ERmB
Come on Camden! #CamdenIs #mylocalculture https://t.co/UljanCirCh
Reckless is the right word.  https://t.co/J9GNL177ah
This is the problem. On the day that David Davis tries to reassure us that there will be no Brexit deregulation etc, his colleague demand the opposite. Farcical is too kind. https://t.co/NuiIOdekrk
Well said @YvetteCooperMP https://t.co/QL4sHcfl9l
Good.  https://t.co/EPrSbeUo6P
Thank you @JanePurdon https://t.co/iqrc0KZh7U
Thanks @RCorbettMEP for chairing. Very good to hear lots of views on Brexit today from across @UKLabour - and in Leeds too, a city I have strong and fond connections with. https://t.co/knEgcMrIuX
Beyond irresponsible. https://t.co/RqOzmFL62u
A great @CamdenLabour team at work today. Thanks all. https://t.co/xg37lwwXVG
Great initiative by @UniteWales - a series of regional conferences to hear &amp; debate members’ views on Brexit. Thanks for inviting me. I will, as ever, reflect on everything said. https://t.co/8jJMz68QF0
Great to come to Cardiff to support my room mate in Westminster, the fab @JoStevensLabour https://t.co/HuT22WsskA

Good on you, Center Parcs.  https://t.co/QtEF9kp0KN
Very busy two days in Wales ahead: series of Brexit impact discussions with Cardiff businesses &amp; trade unions; members event with @AnnaMcMorrin; campaign session with @JoStevensLabour team; then @WelshLabour gala dinner. Tomorrow @unitetheunion Wales Brexit conference.
Rumbled. https://t.co/RIVcIYGd0f
Good. Keeping a customs union with the EU on the negotiating table is a necessary minimum. https://t.co/LORg0eFc92
Boris Johnson speaks for Boris Johnson. No one is taken in by him anymore. He does not speak for business, communities, regions or nations. Just himself. Always himself. https://t.co/80u85zm8I0
Looking forward to joining you for this important event @RichardCotton10 https://t.co/osdhClswMY
Go @carolynharris24 ! A strong voice for the voiceless. https://t.co/AUOWqY0zPk
You are right. @JennyChapman is very impressive. She is in my fabulous team with @PaulBlomfieldMP @mtpennycook @HayteratLords @EmmaHardyMP &amp; @jessicamordenmp. Like them all, she speaks from the front bench &amp; is respected across the House of Commons. https://t.co/kuarQttgZq
Always great to cross back into my Holborn &amp; St Pancras constituency. Tonight on the Eurostar back from two days of intense but encouraging political meetings in Paris.
Time for those advocating hard Brexit to take responsibility for their decisions instead of blaming others. https://t.co/S43vGfePgb
On top form today @RachelReevesMP - excuses cannot be subcontracted out. https://t.co/lIFt6moutN
So great to see so many young people fully engaged with the political issues of our time. The future belongs to them, not to the right wing Brexiteers of the Tory party. https://t.co/UojXbFzhkA
Good to have further discussions about the Brexit negotiations with chief EU negotiator, Michel Barnier, in London today. https://t.co/LPatExeh0V
First, judges as ‘enemies of the people’. Second, politicians as ‘traitors’. Now an attack on our civil service. This march of the hard right needs to be stopped. https://t.co/JyuRpsIlZK
An apology only when the audio recording emerged. Not very impressive. https://t.co/4iGzzo9mIj
This takes such incredible courage - but makes such a difference. What a fabulous politician @SharonHodgsonMP is. https://t.co/YPPys650zO
Quite right @CER_Grant - the question from @Jacob_Rees_Mogg &amp; answer from @SteveBakerHW do not reflect well on either of them. https://t.co/97RxQyvE7R
Such an inspiring group of talented artists - thanks @THEActionSpace https://t.co/WHiTy0h2OB

Four days chasing the govt for the leaked Brexit papers. Now at bingo night at my childrens’ local primary school!
And in my book, urgently means end of the week, latest. https://t.co/Gq15ZqSuSg
Good work. https://t.co/xfHwrAteHo
We tried a new initiative in Gospel Oak tonight - getting local residents, police, estate managers &amp; us lot (politicians!) together to discuss knife crime, drugs &amp; how to make our streets &amp; estates safer. Packed out! Thanks to all for coming. https://t.co/UNxc0FzCPj
Success! Government forced to back down &amp; release Brexit impact papers. Speaker says must do so urgently. Victory for common sense, transparency &amp; accountability. https://t.co/COVrTdLUdi
Great to be there to support. Green space, cleaner air &amp; less car travel in Camden: what’s not to like! https://t.co/ZKVlSjInPh
Looking forward to meeting Gospel Oak residents tonight to discuss their concerns about local crime, anti-social behaviour &amp; safety issues. https://t.co/cAmqgaY6Uk
Ministers commissioned these economic impact papers. To rubbish them now as their first line of defence is frankly ridiculous. https://t.co/LBTijviAut
Really sad news. Henry was a champion of human rights, access to justice &amp; the rule of law. And a lovely man with it. Fought to the end. https://t.co/YkdJTZS43F
Good round of meetings with political parties in Northern Ireland today. https://t.co/vlNgCuSt2L
Spent the day on the Derry/Donegal border talking to businesses &amp; locals. Those ruling out a Customs Union with the EU should come here.  https://t.co/sLOGLmsBWk
Sure @GusAlston - @KTCityFarm is one of Kentish Town’s many gems! https://t.co/oIzT8Z5GkY

Truly incredible courage from Tessa. HoL right to break protocol with standing ovation. https://t.co/pmzsj1TKnf
The bickering between David Davis &amp; Jacob Rees-Mogg is the starkest evidence yet that a Brexit transitional deal is far from secure under this government. https://t.co/DnO8V8sNmK

Great event on both occasions @JemimaLovatt. Tonight debating Brexit. Back then discussing human rights. They are related issues! https://t.co/cJx1Y2jD1G
Incredibly moving testimonies from Holocaust survivor &amp; Bosnian Genocide survivor at Mayor of London/London Assembly Holocaust Memorial event today #thepowerofwords
Important intervention from the CBI. Labour will push govt. to secure Brexit transitional arrangements urgently &amp; to put a Customs Union back on the negotiating table for the long term. https://t.co/d7Z5CDTpvo

Setting out Labour's first 2018 Brexit challenge to the govt. There will be many more ...   The referendum does not require us to surrender our core values, including the robust protection of human rights. Nor will we. https://t.co/L6AVIl56iP
Happy New Year! Let's hope 2018 is peaceful, less divisive and driven by progressive values in Britain, Europe and across the globe.

As Parliament closes down today for Xmas, a big thank you to my fantastic @ShadowBrexit team, MPs &amp; staff. Huge &amp; tough challenges every day, literally every day; you could all have chosen easier roles but instead you made a real difference. Thanks.
After a hectic Parliamentary session, so good to be able to support @AshantiCharity providing water to remote areas of Ghana. A reminder of the struggles of the world we live in. https://t.co/wpifxyqknX
So tomorrow the govt will press its gimmick Brexit 'exit day' amendment. And then support an amendment to amend its (then ten minutes old) amendment. And that's sound government?
On way to Brussels for another packed day of meetings with EU &amp; political leaders. Plenty of these in 2017!
Britain at it's best. https://t.co/ueUrjsK4CK

Thanks for inviting me @RuthSmeeth @gareth_snell - Stoke members in good spirits tonight! https://t.co/kqw0PnyfyK
After a car-crash defeat on Brexit vote, rumours that PM will now U-turn on gimmick exit day amendment: forced to get a Tory MP to amend her own amendment before its put to the vote!
This was a great launch with powerful voices from victims, former offenders, support teams, the police &amp; cross party politicians. Great initiative by Council leader @Georgia_Gould &amp; Cllr @abs_hai https://t.co/pk98seEUJe

When judges uphold the law, they are branded enemies of the people. When MPs uphold democracy, they are branded traitors. Never has it been more important to reassert our values. https://t.co/baELrja6td
Victory on Grieve amendment! Labour overwhelmingly backed vote &amp; with courageous Tories voting with us, parliament now votes on Brexit terms
Labour will back Dominic Grieve's amendment giving Parliament a proper say on the Brexit deal if he pushes it to a vote tonight. The terms of our future are not for the government alone to determine.
Spooked by its own right wing, govt already trying to row back from phase 1 agreement?  https://t.co/EHorVEfGu9
After a tumultuous week in parliament, its great to be out with a huge &amp; enthusiastic @CamdenLabour team campaigning this morning! https://t.co/yDpR8X2AWl
As Brexit talks now move on, PM must reflect on her approach. Another year of chaos &amp; confusion not acceptable. Or farcical scenes that put jobs &amp; economy at risk.
Good that Brexit talks can move on. Need to know political price of compromise. Need to agree transitional arrangements on same terms ASAP.
Thanks @wokinglabour for a great reception tonight. Just caught the train to get home! https://t.co/GC9B8wB35E

On train out of Paddington to @WitneyLabourCLP - looking forward to members' event to talk about Brexit &amp; Britain.
Good meeting today with key adviser in Italy. Keeping dialogue open with EU partners is vital. https://t.co/nT4CxeaeqU
Great little clip to promote Camden culture bid https://t.co/AWLUO4VNgi
Camden is...culture with every step https://t.co/jHcnUyhGS5
Quite apart from the bits the govt wants to hide, the fact that govt's 'assessment' of its Brexit approach on the UK economy only runs to 2 lever arch files is a major concern! https://t.co/9GqNXzSSd5
Not good enough. The vote was clear &amp; binding. Reports in full should be handed over. We intend to press this issue. https://t.co/g15JIKodSv
And I need to drop an apostrophe! https://t.co/E6h7brXUeB
PM's big problems going into next few weeks: flawed red lines on ECJ; sweeping options such as customs union off the table; and her foreign secretary. Need's to change all three.
Let's stop this perpetual argument about funding for refuges by making funding mandatory. Save lives &amp; protect rather than investigate afterwards. https://t.co/7epDYMVyjM
Thanks Humayun &amp; Shuting - unaccompanied teenagers seeking asylum - for cooking lunch today. Note to Home Office: 18 months for a decision? https://t.co/2vT2R5YJzq
Labour's clear &amp; settled position on single market &amp; customs union: in both for transitional period on same terms; retain benefits long term; new single market relationship &amp; a customs union are viable long term options  https://t.co/uEAbV6yMmc
Beautiful blue sky in Kentish Town as I walk to my constituency advice surgery in Queens Crescent Community Centre. Long queue outside ...
Productive discussions with the V4 Ambassadors today: Hungary Poland Slovak and Czech Republics. https://t.co/hBpmqPMKP5
Congratulations @SarahBrownUK on 15th anniversary of @Theirworld - helping children fulfil their potential. https://t.co/7vMJ4oWneM
An important reminder that there should never be time limits on justice in cases of genocide. https://t.co/6EGjlWAG8g
Labour amendment to keep Charter of Fundamental Rights lost by just 10 votes. We will keep pushing ... https://t.co/NtMrl1DQGi
John &amp; Penny - thanks for all your great work campaigning for much needed safe refuge centres for victims of sexual violence. Should be mandatory. https://t.co/DQ9T9T9OvH
We will be backing protection of human rights in tomorrow's Withdrawal Bill votes. https://t.co/SAr66EXdjs
Big loss for UK and ICJ. https://t.co/rYzrBGwD6l
MitzvahDay just gets stronger &amp; stronger every year. Interfaith at its best. Great work. https://t.co/FuaM9msn7p
Great to see my local Kentish Town Bengal Lancer chef pick up one of the chef of the year awards here at @ BCA dinner tonight.
The govt's Brexit strategy is bad enough without these two Brexit freelancers making things worse. https://t.co/Af516CrSIV
With Frank Dobson, neighbouring MP @TulipSiddiq, Camden leader @Georgia_Gould &amp; Cllr  @flickrea in remembrance of Kings Cross fire victims. https://t.co/LlfCNji0BU
Please stop for a moment's silence today if you are near Kings Cross to remember these families &amp; our courageous emergency services 30 years on. https://t.co/6PmC7c5Zfy
This captures @FrancesOGrady brilliantly. A great @The_TUC leader. https://t.co/NEBuzfXUaI
At home govt lays deeply political amendments to Withdrawal Bill. Abroad it lectures others not to put politics above prosperity. You couldn't make it up.  https://t.co/hiG3lOe30f
Thank you @GWLabour for hosting me at your full house fundraiser. Great CLP: committed, welcoming &amp; winning! Great MP in Matt Pennycook. https://t.co/90vRvUbEp8
Let's hope that when they are eventually released next week, DEXEU Brexit impact assessments show clear plan to avoid this!  https://t.co/n1xp2vNsgD
Good appointment. https://t.co/znAH0PfFei
Govt exit date amendment to #EUWithdrawalBill is an irresponsible gimmick. Labour will vote against it. https://t.co/g5FSLDT37g
Too right! https://t.co/fCZdu2GT1g
I have written to PM. The only way to face down her Brexit extremists, who will drive us to 'no deal', is to accept Labour's amendments to the Withdrawal Bill. Act now in the national interest; not party interest. https://t.co/dPMAMiqL3B
Moving Remembrance Day service at St Pancras Church today with all faiths &amp; none coming together in peace to remember all those who gave so much for our freedom. https://t.co/CgFLLtgxj7
Great to meet you @acumella even if very briefly! Hope photo is ok. https://t.co/DRVobWdnXE
The charge against Johnson: repeatedly letting our country down. Lots of evidence. https://t.co/cXS4FJF4Zy
Spare us! https://t.co/7TthEyKfx8
Instructions from Boris Johnson &amp; Michael Gove are the last thing our country needs. https://t.co/WovydyTkSu
There was a time when a UK foreign secretary (of any party) had authority &amp; respect. Not now.   https://t.co/0TDP2A0m5N
Great event today: helping homeless people in Camden into jobs. @C4WSCamden &amp; @RichardCotton10 leading the way. Don't walk on by. https://t.co/clgRyMW2GD
Fantastic result for a fantastic candidate @JennyMulholland - @CamdenLabour at its very best! https://t.co/zC9UhSfxjo
Series of Brexit meetings in Sweden yesterday, including good discussions with Swedish Minister for Trade &amp; EU Affairs @AnnLinde https://t.co/Pe1BZScQZe
Good.https://t.co/ELXjq9vCmU
You are a powerful voice @CloughJohn. Everyone who cares about ending violence against women &amp; girls needs to hear you. https://t.co/vSkF2cUfrS
Great from @mtpennycook: last month DExEU told FOI team they 'held' the information; now says it doesn't really exist as requested! Come on. https://t.co/TJXIC5zJAP
Great discussions here in Norway about Brexit over last two days including with @USverdrup &amp; his excellent @nupinytt team. Sweden next stop. https://t.co/kBBCLNSF94
How much more do we have to endure from a Foreign Secretary who's achieved nothing in office &amp; caused untold damage? https://t.co/pduW4KpJnp
Thanks for having me to this year's Bar/Young Bar conference: Justice, equality &amp; rule of law matter more than even in these uncertain times https://t.co/J1Ff494Md6
Lively discussion this morning @ Trilateral Commission. Different points of view is an understatement: different visions for Britain! https://t.co/4kVl9HIDbv
Spot on @alexsmith1982 - govt refuses to vote on Wednesdays for fear of losing; and talks out debate on Friday for fear of losing. Weak. https://t.co/E69MMDUZf2
Great session at local Camden school William Ellis today with @ActionTutoring doing great work. Pupils gave me a good grilling at the end! https://t.co/PjZXWlve4h
Great session with young people on UK's future &amp; Brexit. Need to listen hard: they have to live with outcome for longer than the rest of us! https://t.co/6w6a22Rxqt
Not before time. Well done @DianaJohnsonMP for an incredible &amp; successful campaign. https://t.co/4UgQjVef0L
I'll be in Parliament to support @JimfromOldham &amp; #VotesAt16 Bill. Long overdue. https://t.co/i7HFViKvmH
Just leaving Euston bound for North Warwickshire CLP Brexit event with @adamjfarrell &amp; party members: a seat we need to win back sharpish!
Govt accepts Labour's Brexit motion is binding &amp; prepares to hand over documents. Ancient procedure; modern remedy.  https://t.co/Mk3bj299lE
Also that full unredacted versions are released to Brexit Select Committee. That's what yesterday's binding motion means. Get on with it. https://t.co/4W8d1J9ZyU
Yes. https://t.co/3zCV2Brc1f
Huge thanks owed to @SeemaMalhotra1 @DavidLammy &amp; many PLP colleagues for relentlessly pursuing this. Impt result.  https://t.co/UBTO7kJQF4
Straight from victory in Parliament on release of Brexit report to really important local debate on school funding in Camden. Great panel. https://t.co/zthge605aZ
Instinct of organisations is to circle wagons &amp; defend themselves. Wrong response. Shine torch on what went wrong. https://t.co/vKDW6MyFMr
Clean Air Act needed. Legal obligations, not political aspirations. https://t.co/Trcq0K4ZnA
Spot on from @HarrietHarman in HoC today: allegations of sexual harassment must be a turning point. Better response needed. Long overdue. https://t.co/6jGzyeronA
No deal will be disastrous for our economy. No doubt Tory donors will be fine. Others will not.   https://t.co/aBKZk5ULVa
Hmmm. David Davis loses 3rd minister in 4 months. Good thing we're not in the middle of most important negotiations. https://t.co/PVetbsZMs0
Thanks @LSESULabour for great discussion &amp; debate. Shame we didn't have more time. Same again in 6-9 months to see how our predictions hold? https://t.co/owwMZVlzR6
Incoherent from David Davis. Parliament to get a 'meaningful' vote on A50 deal after its agreed! I don't think so.   https://t.co/ZRHNIx8k6s
This is getting ridiculous. Every Wednesday, govt refuses to vote or gives in. Too weak to govern? https://t.co/yEmyxwQjLF
The answer must  be 'no' from all universities. Outrageous letter. https://t.co/VFnMO6qgvv
Packed H&amp;SP Labour Party AGM tonight. Celebrating our membership of 4,000. Proud to be the MP @CamdenLabour https://t.co/IySNog84ov
Just when the country &amp; businesses want certainty, PM serves up the opposite. So much for listening to businesses. https://t.co/eE2StWwfcH
Really important opportunity to discuss the crisis in school funding in Camden. Thanks @ollylaw for organising. https://t.co/rDyjrooiAH
The Great Repeal Bill has become the Great Standstill. Deep divisions in govt mean no progress. Not good enough.   https://t.co/hUDlN9BrNc
Great night @CurryLifeMag awards ceremony: top chefs &amp; teams getting much due recognition. Good to see MPs  @rushanaraali @wesstreeting here https://t.co/824YP8pxv7
In Parliament David Davis described 'no deal' as a negotiating tactic; thus destroying it as a negotiating tactic.   https://t.co/smak173M3X
Great debate @AshfieldLabour - full house brimming with questions &amp; comments - @GloriaDePiero has a great team here! https://t.co/DVfNybvyWz
Govt’s 4% cut in Border staff in last few years not looking so clever.  https://t.co/sxw6hnvniC
Finished busy constituency surgery: now on train speeding northwards to speak @AshfieldLabour with great MP @GloriaDePiero on Brexit.
Human rights, Brexit and everything in-between: extracts from my talk at JW3 centre on Tuesday.  https://t.co/p46hIgClMY
Added extra advice surgery for constituents this week to try new venue @phc_library in Primrose Hill today: all local residents welcome.
Impasse in Brexit negotiations. Impasse on EU Withdrawal Bill. 3 line whip to avoid UC vote. Govt in paralysis. Time to go.
Govt refused early scrutiny 6 months ago; refused our suggested changes; refused advice from own MPs. Now its stuck. https://t.co/800zy23mPp
Great meeting with MEPs in Brussels today discussing all aspects of Brexit. https://t.co/Y3Ix0wGnti
In Brussels for packed day of Brexit meetings ahead of EU Council meeting on Friday: Including busy session with our Labour MEPs on arrival.
Cabinet split is the permanent headline. It’s also the biggest risk to Brexit negotiations.  https://t.co/BCHDIUaLuJ
Great debate &amp; challenge @Rene_Cassin JW3 tonight. Put me through my paces on human rights, Brexit &amp; the state of politics! https://t.co/bCpKJYCBBa
Thanks CBI for inviting me to give keynote speech at the President's Dinner tonight. Working with business, we can make such a difference. https://t.co/CanEGTW28v
Just awful.  https://t.co/nbCz6pWP4U

What an incredible group of people: success against the odds! Congratulations all @WMCollege https://t.co/AUgW9ciJGJ
At one of my favourite local events: success night @WMCollege - incredible individual stories &amp; achievements overcoming so much to succeed.
True - @LDNVictimsComm has led the way on this &amp; good to see @VictimsComm now on board. Over to govt to deliver! https://t.co/A7YVlehdyT
Shocking is an overused word in politics. But premium rate 55p-a-minute helpline for those trying to sort out their universal credit issues? https://t.co/9PZMDH9Z0r
@DavidLammy &amp; @SeemaMalhotra1 spot on with this initiative. Fully support. https://t.co/fMJn2J8S05
This is the problem when you use people as bargaining chips. If the bargain fails, they suffer. https://t.co/TRI2XEYE9Y
Strong @DeathPenaltyP statement on World Anti-Death Penalty day - an arbitrary, cruel &amp; inhuman punishment anywhere. https://t.co/R8ZQQrDo8E
No deal is the worst of all situations. A strong govt would not be in this position. Tory divisions risk driving us all off a cliff edge. https://t.co/6dnQT2Jq6L
If Rees-Mogg against it, it’s almost certainly a step in the right direction.  https://t.co/Jfl9Nj9IiV
Tory infighting puts self-interest above national interest at crucial stage of Brexit negotiations. Unacceptable.  https://t.co/W2854Omomi
Thanks all @CamdenLabour members &amp; supporters out with us today. Great team! https://t.co/eelegsi9ju
Thanks to Gilbey Yard tenants &amp; residents for showing me round proposed redevelopment: Now attending their AGM to listen to local concerns.

Delighted to be in Leeds for this event with new @UKLabour MP @alexsobel - it's where I went to university &amp; it's a fabulous city! https://t.co/1UcXoINIDu
Thanks @JamesKellyLab - it was great to be in Scotland last weekend campaigning for @UKLabour &amp; @megalennon https://t.co/vqTkSXlj5i
Not going to mock physical struggle of PM's speech; organ donation stuff important; but can't hide fact that govt has no ideas or strategy. https://t.co/mO9z725DyE
Great night saying thanks &amp; good luck to our great colleague Chloe who is going onto to become a lawyer! -  one of our fab #TeamStarmer https://t.co/LoQ0SNRmDm
Sad news of Rodney Bickerstaffe's death: a great trade unionist, much respected member of our Constituency Party &amp; good friend @unisontweets

Paisley Labour team &amp; @D_G_Alexander campaigning in good spirits today despite torrential rain! @scottishlabour https://t.co/VUYdTz0fIW
Public sector has already been cut. A lot. They all work more for less. Why indulge a politician so out of touch? https://t.co/0KxrYDokQw
Great privilege to deliver @ScottishFabians speech tonight in Glasgow: like #Lab17 Brighton conference, room bursting with ideas &amp; energy. https://t.co/SpLPq03YwQ
Great to campaign with @LesleyLaird &amp; team in Greenock today! Upwards and onwards. https://t.co/Kd9CEmRlBb

Much looking forward to a few days campaigning in Scotland. This team Labour 'constant campaign' mode is catching! https://t.co/pycjMQ2cry
Honoured to be elected Patron of Euston Foodbank last night: shame needed in 21st century; but all volunteers deserve big thanks @caryatid9
He just wants a Brexit for Boris Johnson. No concern whatsoever about the national interest. Obvious he never actually talks to businesses. https://t.co/LEgYLTnFnI
Trade: US style. That's why Brexit focus should be on strong UK/EU trading agreement.  https://t.co/nYnrLTuFNg
Fantastic conference speech from @jeremycorbyn. Only Labour can offer hope for the future. Next election can't come soon enough.
PM didn't need to go to Florence to accept that Labour is right about Brexit transitional arrangements. Not much else in the speech.
PM needs to face down Foreign Secretary &amp; the fantasy Brexiteers; &amp; abandon her inflexible &amp; ideological red lines. https://t.co/K0VdfhDg8z
Thanks for inviting me - great evening with Mitcham &amp; Morden Labour Party members &amp; friends. https://t.co/He4Q7hVb2n

Congratulations to @Georgia_Gould @1Meric &amp; @jenheadlamwells reselected as @CamdenLabour Kentish Town ward candidates by overwhelming vote!
Moving key individuals at this critical time adds a whole new dimension to govt's chaotic approach to Brexit. https://t.co/EdkPyosqwl
We were there!   Strong family links with Doncaster.   Great  day out. https://t.co/tnulAzPLiN
Serious air quality issues in my constituency already; HS2 construction will make worse. Many residents very concerned. They deserve better. https://t.co/3flbtTVsOQ
A govt hell bent on avoiding accountability: power grab Withdrawal Bill; fixing select committees; now avoiding opposition day motions. https://t.co/FKKvueh2ea
Very significant: shows there is no House of Commons majority for public sector pay cap in this Parliament. #GE17 https://t.co/S08hJzvsFP
Great Labour win! https://t.co/soZAtQE3am
Well well well ... eventually govt will accept &amp; follow Labour's sensible lead on Brexit transitional arrangements. https://t.co/L3LzqNv3vo
Cllr @ollylaw gives it everything at lively York Rise street party in Highgate this afternoon! @CamdenLabour @SallyGimson https://t.co/zr38BtulfY
Great night in Sheffield! Thanks @LouHaigh &amp; team. https://t.co/aqihAJWev4
David Davis seems to have forgotten the importance of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights! https://t.co/7ozu3dgf1k
Very interesting @IPPR report on how Britain's economic model needs radical reform. https://t.co/QjrmVK16Yd
This Bill would reduce MPs to spectators as it pours power into hands of ministers. So much for taking back control! https://t.co/RwBjY1Yqcf
Great @FrancesOGrady article exposing many flaws in EU Withdrawal Bill. Rights at work at risk if govt gets its way. https://t.co/JxfjVjq8ky
@FrancesOGrady quite right: EU Withdrawal Bill means rights at work protected today could be gone tomorrow @TUCnews  https://t.co/FmWnwCObBq
Friends even! https://t.co/YiXhORgGGh
Eid Mubarak to all my fiends and colleagues celebrating in Holborn &amp; St Pancras and beyond!

No ‘constructive ambiguity’. Labour will fight hard Brexit: my Observer article. https://t.co/TELqw0PtZ3
Labour now has a strong and united purpose in fighting hard Brexit.  https://t.co/pQmpEhsAeh
Thanks for invitation to join Plymouth by Skype @LukePollard - Plymouth Brexit summit such a good idea: look forward to ideas coming from it https://t.co/oIxwugBs7Q
If govt agreed Labour's demand - first made July 2016 - to guarantee EU citizens rights, this wouldn't have happened https://t.co/waK0IAvpF1
Totally agree @jessphillips https://t.co/S3H5E2gQmJ
Just had keyhole surgery (knee &amp; yes, football!) at local @uclh hospital. All staff - from UK, EU &amp; beyond - brilliant. Thanks to all ❤️NHS.
Good to go away on hols &amp; we had a fab time with our kids in France, but always great to step back into Kentish Town &amp; Holborn &amp; St Pancras!
@sirpauljenkins is right: PM's obsession that deal with EU cannot involve ECJ or any court makes close future partnership near impossible. https://t.co/aGcmddR8yr
Well said @MrBrendanCox - whole country saddened by passing of Bernard Kenny. https://t.co/QNxIIzwvky
Govt should commit to strong transitional arrangements on same basic terms as now - including single market &amp; customs union. https://t.co/zR48RhINOL
Brilliant @pollytoynbee take down of Jacob Rees-Mogg: his only 'authenticy' is right wing pro hard-Brexit Tory dogma https://t.co/qu4laznjxo
Very imp case links claimants' vulnerability, no legal aid &amp; advice desert caused by cuts: real indictment of govt.  https://t.co/IEWiju6ju5
Yes, of course. Will get that organised. See you there @silvervoter @LauraPidcockMP https://t.co/2PKw4bhLDu
Great letter by my colleague @PaulBlomfieldMP - uncertainty for EU nationals already leading to discrimination. https://t.co/W3KzWMxCVQ
Labour will work with others to ensure Brexit transition on same basic terms: including single market &amp; custom union https://t.co/yt8X47gNjM
Thanks Paul for organising: really great constituency event in back of local pub. Informal, cross party, direct &amp; all questions welcomed. https://t.co/nJvC0NTSUT
This is getting ridiculous ...  Everyday a new contradiction: now  back to square one it seems.  https://t.co/uxyxtl2YiW
Ideology and self interest should not prevail over national interest. Transition on current terms is a must.  https://t.co/298Uli5DlJ
Let this be the final burial of the flawed idea that 'no deal' is viable.   Transition on current terms is a must. https://t.co/WA4okwtKC1
Super busy constituency advice surgery. Lots more cases to go. Someone waiting popped out &amp; got me strong cup of tea: just the job, thanks!
It is vital that we retain the benefits of single market &amp; customs union: options should not be swept off the table. https://t.co/WUM6xct3In
Huge important win: Supreme Ct unanimously rules high Employment Tribunal fees unlawful. Victory for @unisontweets and for access to justice https://t.co/dig6MKUybq

Threatening Gt Ormond St staff is totally unacceptable. Full stop.  https://t.co/IRwIfCCiFm
This is very good news.   About time we had a female President of the Supreme Court - and no one better than Baroness Hale! https://t.co/rqs4zjzZKv
Incidentally is there any pair of politicians you would trust less with your future than this pair! https://t.co/2qLrFnAawq
Finally govt accepts Labour manifesto position: Brexit needs transitional measures. Next battle - destination!  https://t.co/2qLrFnAawq
Great to be with fab @CamdenLabour members from our Camden Town/Primrose Hill branch last night: thanking them for all their work &amp; support. https://t.co/7YoKjoEmP5
Slipped out today hoping no one noticed: PM spent £1.2m of taxpayers money fighting A50 case. What a waste of Money! https://t.co/LXjao1b816

PM's inflexible approach to the ECJ &amp; Euratom exposes a critical flaw in her entire Brexit approach.  https://t.co/a95t9Pg9yf?
Govt in denial. Says transitional Brexit arrangements necessary because UK ready but other EU countries are not!  https://t.co/9Xy2y4zlxF
Thanks @TUCGlobal for important Brexit discussions with German trade unions today. Working people across Europe have many shared interests. https://t.co/6sjPfmHBat
PM should put nuclear safety &amp; jobs first by dropping purely ideological red line on future role of ECJ in Euratom. https://t.co/UfYSYFg8Z9
PM says pay rise of more than 1% for teachers  would be unfair on low paid nurses.   An insult to both!  https://t.co/6oP4flWWmy

Great to spend evening in my own @CamdenLabour CLP listening to @jessphillips &amp; @tomschuller48: both I respect hugely talking lots of sense!
Thanks to brave work of @LondonFire team, Camden fire contained: please support traders 'business as usual' response https://t.co/SU0HFtSqAE
Business and trade unions speak with one voice on this. PM is the outlier with her extreme Brexit interpretation.   https://t.co/1HEhuc4VnO
Govt needs to reset its approach. We need early commitment to transitional Brexit arrangements on similar terms to those we curently enjoy. https://t.co/V4DqBxdUZ6

UCL Annual Eleanor Roosevelt Lecture: Human Rights after Brexit. Here's the full text of my speech.  https://t.co/5QPDdmyWkT
@AlfDubs right: govt broken promise. Having spent time in refugee camps last year w unaccompanied refugee children, I know we need to help.

PM has taken high risk approach. A speech with gaps, inconsistencies &amp; uncertainties is not a plan. She now needs to deliver. https://t.co/JIpKMgWIAy
EU bemused by PM's threat to turn UK into deregulated tax haven: a threat rightly described as self harm.  https://t.co/zOYB9jufDU
For months PM won't disclose Brexit plan to Parliament. Now drip feeds it to media &amp; makes speech not statement in HoC! Accountability gap.

Too little: too late. Justice Secretary needs to be much stronger in defence of our independent judges. https://t.co/UD0WntSaAU
PM should be far more ambitious in Brexit approach: fighting for full access to single market &amp; in customs union: act in national interest. https://t.co/S9yewK1bn8
PM was wrong to have attempted to sideline Parliament: now needs to subject her Brexit approach to proper scrutiny. https://t.co/cAqoaodoIk
