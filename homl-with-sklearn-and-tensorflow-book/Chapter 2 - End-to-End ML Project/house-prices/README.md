## House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

This project was undertaken to exercise my abilities with predictive regression models on a non-trival dataset. The dataset being used describes the sale of individual residential properties in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. A link to the original paper describing the work is provided [here](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf).

TLDR: the final model generated was a trained Random Forest Machine Learning model tuned with RandomizedSearch using Scikit-Learn. No evaluation was carried out due to the abscence of labels in the test set. Future development would involve dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g. PCA) and further feature selection and extraction methods.

The Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow book (Chapter 2) facilitated with this project, which described an implemented a full end-to-end solution for a data science problem. I decided to utilise these steps on a new dataset for personal development. The final output is a submission.csv file containing house price predictions on a provided test set.
