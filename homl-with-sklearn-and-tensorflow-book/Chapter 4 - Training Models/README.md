## Linear Regression

This folder contains source code for a from-scratch OOP implementation of linear regression, taken from HOML Chapter 4 Training Models.

The key idea of linear regression is to estimate the parameters of a linear function of input features by minimising the Root Mean Square Error cost function (RMSE) on the training set. Using the Normal Equation, we can obtain a closed-form solution which yields parameters directly which minimise the cost function. Using these estimated parameters we can now compute predictions for items in the test set.

### Usage
```
python3 main.py
