# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow Book

My solutions to exercises in the Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow book by Aurélien 
Géron (inlc. book solutions where appropriate).

`wrappers/` contains code for custom implementations and wrappers for algorithms covered in the book.
